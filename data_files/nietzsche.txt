CHAPTER I. PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS


1. The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous
enterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have
hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will to Truth not
laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is
already a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is
it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn
impatiently away? That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions
ourselves? WHO is it really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really
is this "Will to Truth" in us? In fact we made a long halt at the
question as to the origin of this Will--until at last we came to an
absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired
about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT
RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the
value of truth presented itself before us--or was it we who presented
ourselves before the problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which
the Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of
interrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as
if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first
to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk
in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.

2. "HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For example, truth
out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception? or the
generous deed out of selfishness? or the pure sun-bright vision of the
wise man out of covetousness? Such genesis is impossible; whoever dreams
of it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the highest
value must have a different origin, an origin of THEIR own--in this
transitory, seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of
delusion and cupidity, they cannot have their source. But rather in
the lap of Being, in the intransitory, in the concealed God, in the
'Thing-in-itself--THERE must be their source, and nowhere else!"--This
mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which
metaphysicians of all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation
is at the back of all their logical procedure; through this "belief" of
theirs, they exert themselves for their "knowledge," for something that
is in the end solemnly christened "the Truth." The fundamental belief of
metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES OF VALUES. It never occurred
even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold (where
doubt, however, was most necessary); though they had made a solemn
vow, "DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM." For it may be doubted, firstly, whether
antitheses exist at all; and secondly, whether the popular valuations
and antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their
seal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates, merely provisional
perspectives, besides being probably made from some corner, perhaps from
below--"frog perspectives," as it were, to borrow an expression current
among painters. In spite of all the value which may belong to the true,
the positive, and the unselfish, it might be possible that a higher
and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to
pretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity. It
might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and
respected things, consists precisely in their being insidiously
related, knotted, and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed
things--perhaps even in being essentially identical with them. Perhaps!
But who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous "Perhapses"!
For that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of
philosophers, such as will have other tastes and inclinations, the
reverse of those hitherto prevalent--philosophers of the dangerous
"Perhaps" in every sense of the term. And to speak in all seriousness, I
see such new philosophers beginning to appear.

3. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read between
their lines long enough, I now say to myself that the greater part of
conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions, and
it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here to
learn anew, as one learned anew about heredity and "innateness." As
little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process
and procedure of heredity, just as little is "being-conscious" OPPOSED
to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the
conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his
instincts, and forced into definite channels. And behind all logic and
its seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak
more plainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite
mode of life For example, that the certain is worth more than the
uncertain, that illusion is less valuable than "truth" such valuations,
in spite of their regulative importance for US, might notwithstanding be
only superficial valuations, special kinds of _niaiserie_, such as may
be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves. Supposing,
in effect, that man is not just the "measure of things."

4. The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is
here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The
question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving,
species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally
inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic
judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that
without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of
reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable,
without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers,
man could not live--that the renunciation of false opinions would be
a renunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A
CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of
value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so,
has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.

5. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully
and half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they
are--how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in
short, how childish and childlike they are,--but that there is not
enough honest dealing with them, whereas they all raise a loud and
virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in
the remotest manner. They all pose as though their real opinions had
been discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure,
divinely indifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics,
who, fairer and foolisher, talk of "inspiration"), whereas, in fact, a
prejudiced proposition, idea, or "suggestion," which is generally
their heart's desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with
arguments sought out after the event. They are all advocates who do not
wish to be regarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of their
prejudices, which they dub "truths,"--and VERY far from having the
conscience which bravely admits this to itself, very far from having
the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be
understood, perhaps to warn friend or foe, or in cheerful confidence
and self-ridicule. The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant, equally
stiff and decent, with which he entices us into the dialectic
by-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his "categorical
imperative"--makes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small
amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical
preachers. Or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical form, by
means of which Spinoza has, as it were, clad his philosophy in mail and
mask--in fact, the "love of HIS wisdom," to translate the term fairly
and squarely--in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart
of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible
maiden, that Pallas Athene:--how much of personal timidity and
vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!

6. It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up
till now has consisted of--namely, the confession of its originator, and
a species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreover
that the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted
the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown.
Indeed, to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a
philosopher have been arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first
ask oneself: "What morality do they (or does he) aim at?" Accordingly,
I do not believe that an "impulse to knowledge" is the father of
philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made
use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument. But whoever
considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining
how far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and
cobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time
or another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to
look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate
LORD over all the other impulses. For every impulse is imperious, and as
SUCH, attempts to philosophize. To be sure, in the case of scholars, in
the case of really scientific men, it may be otherwise--"better," if
you will; there there may really be such a thing as an "impulse to
knowledge," some kind of small, independent clock-work, which, when well
wound up, works away industriously to that end, WITHOUT the rest of
the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein. The actual
"interests" of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another
direction--in the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics;
it is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his little
machine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a
good philologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not
CHARACTERISED by becoming this or that. In the philosopher, on the
contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all,
his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to WHO HE
IS,--that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature
stand to each other.

7. How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more stinging
than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the
Platonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. In its original sense,
and on the face of it, the word signifies "Flatterers of
Dionysius"--consequently, tyrants' accessories and lick-spittles;
besides this, however, it is as much as to say, "They are all ACTORS,
there is nothing genuine about them" (for Dionysiokolax was a popular
name for an actor). And the latter is really the malignant reproach that
Epicurus cast upon Plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner, the
mise en scene style of which Plato and his scholars were masters--of
which Epicurus was not a master! He, the old school-teacher of Samos,
who sat concealed in his little garden at Athens, and wrote three
hundred books, perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato, who
knows! Greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden-god
Epicurus really was. Did she ever find out?

8. There is a point in every philosophy at which the "conviction" of
the philosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in the words of an
ancient mystery:

Adventavit asinus, Pulcher et fortissimus.

9. You desire to LIVE "according to Nature"? Oh, you noble Stoics, what
fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly
extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration,
without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain:
imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power--how COULD you live
in accordance with such indifference? To live--is not that just
endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing,
preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different?
And granted that your imperative, "living according to Nature," means
actually the same as "living according to life"--how could you do
DIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves
are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you:
while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature,
you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players
and self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and
ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein;
you insist that it shall be Nature "according to the Stoa," and would
like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal
glorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truth,
you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such
hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically,
that you are no longer able to see it otherwise--and to crown all, some
unfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that
BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselves--Stoicism is
self-tyranny--Nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is
not the Stoic a PART of Nature?... But this is an old and everlasting
story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today,
as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always
creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy
is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the
will to "creation of the world," the will to the causa prima.

10. The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness, with
which the problem of "the real and the apparent world" is dealt with at
present throughout Europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and
he who hears only a "Will to Truth" in the background, and nothing else,
cannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears. In rare and isolated
cases, it may really have happened that such a Will to Truth--a certain
extravagant and adventurous pluck, a metaphysician's ambition of the
forlorn hope--has participated therein: that which in the end always
prefers a handful of "certainty" to a whole cartload of beautiful
possibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience,
who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing, rather than in an
uncertain something. But that is Nihilism, and the sign of a despairing,
mortally wearied soul, notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a
virtue may display. It seems, however, to be otherwise with stronger
and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life. In that they side
AGAINST appearance, and speak superciliously of "perspective," in
that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the
credibility of the ocular evidence that "the earth stands still," and
thus, apparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession
to escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly than
in one's body?),--who knows if they are not really trying to win back
something which was formerly an even securer possession, something
of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the "immortal
soul," perhaps "the old God," in short, ideas by which they could live
better, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously, than by
"modern ideas"? There is DISTRUST of these modern ideas in this mode
of looking at things, a disbelief in all that has been constructed
yesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety
and scorn, which can no longer endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the
most varied origin, such as so-called Positivism at present throws on
the market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair
motleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom
there is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness. Therein it
seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists and
knowledge-microscopists of the present day; their instinct, which repels
them from MODERN reality, is unrefuted... what do their retrograde
by-paths concern us! The main thing about them is NOT that they wish
to go "back," but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom. A little MORE
strength, swing, courage, and artistic power, and they would be OFF--and
not back!

11. It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to
divert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on
German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which
he set upon himself. Kant was first and foremost proud of his Table of
Categories; with it in his hand he said: "This is the most difficult
thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics." Let us
only understand this "could be"! He was proud of having DISCOVERED a
new faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. Granting
that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid
flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, and
on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible
something--at all events "new faculties"--of which to be still
prouder!--But let us reflect for a moment--it is high time to do so.
"How are synthetic judgments a priori POSSIBLE?" Kant asks himself--and
what is really his answer? "BY MEANS OF A MEANS (faculty)"--but
unfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly,
and with such display of German profundity and verbal flourishes, that
one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved
in such an answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this
new faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant further
discovered a moral faculty in man--for at that time Germans were still
moral, not yet dabbling in the "Politics of hard fact." Then came
the honeymoon of German philosophy. All the young theologians of the
Tubingen institution went immediately into the groves--all seeking for
"faculties." And what did they not find--in that innocent, rich, and
still youthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, the
malicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish
between "finding" and "inventing"! Above all a faculty for the
"transcendental"; Schelling christened it, intellectual intuition,
and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally
pious-inclined Germans. One can do no greater wrong to the whole of
this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness,
notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly, in hoary and senile
conceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with moral
indignation. Enough, however--the world grew older, and the dream
vanished. A time came when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still
rub them today. People had been dreaming, and first and foremost--old
Kant. "By means of a means (faculty)"--he had said, or at least meant to
say. But, is that--an answer? An explanation? Or is it not rather merely
a repetition of the question? How does opium induce sleep? "By means of
a means (faculty)," namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in
Moliere,

    Quia est in eo virtus dormitiva,
    Cujus est natura sensus assoupire.

But such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time
to replace the Kantian question, "How are synthetic judgments a PRIORI
possible?" by another question, "Why is belief in such judgments
necessary?"--in effect, it is high time that we should understand
that such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the
preservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still might
naturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spoken, and roughly and
readily--synthetic judgments a priori should not "be possible" at all;
we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false
judgments. Only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as
plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view
of life. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which
"German philosophy"--I hope you understand its right to inverted commas
(goosefeet)?--has exercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is
no doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to
German philosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous,
the mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the
political obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to the still
overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into
this, in short--"sensus assoupire."...

12. As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted
theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps
no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious
signification to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an
abbreviation of the means of expression)--thanks chiefly to the Pole
Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest
and most successful opponents of ocular evidence. For while Copernicus
has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth
does NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the
last thing that "stood fast" of the earth--the belief in "substance," in
"matter," in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest
triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. One
must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war
to the knife, against the "atomistic requirements" which still lead a
dangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more
celebrated "metaphysical requirements": one must also above all give
the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which
Christianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM. Let it be
permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the
soul as something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, as a monad,
as an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science! Between
ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of "the soul" thereby,
and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses--as
happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists, who can hardly
touch on the soul without immediately losing it. But the way is open
for new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such
conceptions as "mortal soul," and "soul of subjective multiplicity,"
and "soul as social structure of the instincts and passions," want
henceforth to have legitimate rights in science. In that the NEW
psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have
hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of
the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into a new desert
and a new distrust--it is possible that the older psychologists had a
merrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds
that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENT--and, who knows?
perhaps to DISCOVER the new.

13. Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the
instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic
being. A living thing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its strength--life
itself is WILL TO POWER; self-preservation is only one of the indirect
and most frequent RESULTS thereof. In short, here, as everywhere else,
let us beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principles!--one of which
is the instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to Spinoza's
inconsistency). It is thus, in effect, that method ordains, which must
be essentially economy of principles.

14. It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural
philosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according
to us, if I may say so!) and NOT a world-explanation; but in so far as
it is based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a
long time to come must be regarded as more--namely, as an explanation.
It has eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and
palpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and
CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes--in fact, it
follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism.
What is clear, what is "explained"? Only that which can be seen and
felt--one must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, the
charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC mode,
consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence--perhaps
among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our
contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining
masters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional
networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses--the
mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and
interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT
different from that which the physicists of today offer us--and likewise
the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workers,
with their principle of the "smallest possible effort," and the greatest
possible blunder. "Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp, there
is also nothing more for men to do"--that is certainly an imperative
different from the Platonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right
imperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge-builders
of the future, who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform.

15. To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist on
the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the
idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes!
Sensualism, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as
heuristic principle. What? And others say even that the external world
is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a part of this external
world, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselves
would be the work of our organs! It seems to me that this is a
complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, if the conception CAUSA SUI is something
fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the external world is NOT the work
of our organs--?

16. There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are
"immediate certainties"; for instance, "I think," or as the superstition
of Schopenhauer puts it, "I will"; as though cognition here got hold
of its object purely and simply as "the thing in itself," without any
falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the
object. I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that "immediate
certainty," as well as "absolute knowledge" and the "thing in itself,"
involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves
from the misleading significance of words! The people on their part may
think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the philosopher
must say to himself: "When I analyze the process that is expressed in
the sentence, 'I think,' I find a whole series of daring assertions, the
argumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps impossible:
for instance, that it is _I_ who think, that there must necessarily be
something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the
part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is an 'ego,'
and finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated by
thinking--that I KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already decided
within myself what it is, by what standard could I determine whether
that which is just happening is not perhaps 'willing' or 'feeling'? In
short, the assertion 'I think,' assumes that I COMPARE my state at the
present moment with other states of myself which I know, in order to
determine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection with
further 'knowledge,' it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for
me."--In place of the "immediate certainty" in which the people may
believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of
metaphysical questions presented to him, veritable conscience questions
of the intellect, to wit: "Whence did I get the notion of 'thinking'?
Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to speak
of an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause, and finally of an 'ego'
as cause of thought?" He who ventures to answer these metaphysical
questions at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception, like
the person who says, "I think, and know that this, at least, is
true, actual, and certain"--will encounter a smile and two notes of
interrogation in a philosopher nowadays. "Sir," the philosopher will
perhaps give him to understand, "it is improbable that you are not
mistaken, but why should it be the truth?"

17. With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never tire
of emphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly recognized by
these credulous minds--namely, that a thought comes when "it" wishes,
and not when "I" wish; so that it is a PERVERSION of the facts of the
case to say that the subject "I" is the condition of the predicate
"think." ONE thinks; but that this "one" is precisely the famous old
"ego," is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and
assuredly not an "immediate certainty." After all, one has even gone too
far with this "one thinks"--even the "one" contains an INTERPRETATION of
the process, and does not belong to the process itself. One infers here
according to the usual grammatical formula--"To think is an activity;
every activity requires an agency that is active; consequently"... It
was pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought, besides
the operating "power," the material particle wherein it resides and out
of which it operates--the atom. More rigorous minds, however, learnt at
last to get along without this "earth-residuum," and perhaps some day we
shall accustom ourselves, even from the logician's point of view, to
get along without the little "one" (to which the worthy old "ego" has
refined itself).

18. It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is
refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle
minds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the "free will"
owes its persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearing
who feels himself strong enough to refute it.

19. Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were
the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us
to understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and
completely known, without deduction or addition. But it again and
again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what
philosophers are in the habit of doing--he seems to have adopted a
POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it. Willing seems to me to be above
all something COMPLICATED, something that is a unity only in name--and
it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got
the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages.
So let us for once be more cautious, let us be "unphilosophical": let
us say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations,
namely, the sensation of the condition "AWAY FROM WHICH we go," the
sensation of the condition "TOWARDS WHICH we go," the sensation of this
"FROM" and "TOWARDS" itself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular
sensation, which, even without our putting in motion "arms and legs,"
commences its action by force of habit, directly we "will" anything.
Therefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are
to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place,
thinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there is
a ruling thought;--and let us not imagine it possible to sever this
thought from the "willing," as if the will would then remain over!
In the third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and
thinking, but it is above all an EMOTION, and in fact the emotion of the
command. That which is termed "freedom of the will" is essentially the
emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: "I am free, 'he'
must obey"--this consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally
so the straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself
exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that "this and
nothing else is necessary now," the inward certainty that obedience
will be rendered--and whatever else pertains to the position of the
commander. A man who WILLS commands something within himself which
renders obedience, or which he believes renders obedience. But now let
us notice what is the strangest thing about the will,--this affair so
extremely complex, for which the people have only one name. Inasmuch as
in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND
the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of
constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually
commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other
hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive
ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term "I": a whole series
of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the
will itself, has become attached to the act of willing--to such a degree
that he who wills believes firmly that willing SUFFICES for action.
Since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will
when the effect of the command--consequently obedience, and therefore
action--was to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into
the sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he who
wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are
somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing,
to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation
of power which accompanies all success. "Freedom of Will"--that is the
expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising
volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with
the executor of the order--who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over
obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will
that overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds the
feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful
"underwills" or under-souls--indeed, our body is but a social structure
composed of many souls--to his feelings of delight as commander. L'EFFET
C'EST MOI. what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed
and happy commonwealth, namely, that the governing class identifies
itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all willing it is
absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as
already said, of a social structure composed of many "souls", on which
account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-such
within the sphere of morals--regarded as the doctrine of the relations
of supremacy under which the phenomenon of "life" manifests itself.

20. That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or
autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with
each other, that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear
in the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to
a system as the collective members of the fauna of a Continent--is
betrayed in the end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the most
diverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme
of POSSIBLE philosophies. Under an invisible spell, they always revolve
once more in the same orbit, however independent of each other they
may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something
within them leads them, something impels them in definite order the
one after the other--to wit, the innate methodology and relationship
of their ideas. Their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a
re-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off,
ancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly
grew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order.
The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and German
philosophizing is easily enough explained. In fact, where there is
affinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of grammar--I mean
owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical
functions--it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset
for a similar development and succession of philosophical systems,
just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of
world-interpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers within the
domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of the subject
is least developed) look otherwise "into the world," and will be
found on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germans and
Mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately
also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuations and racial conditions.--So
much by way of rejecting Locke's superficiality with regard to the
origin of ideas.

21. The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been
conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the
extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and
frightfully with this very folly. The desire for "freedom of will"
in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway,
unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear
the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and
to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom,
involves nothing less than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and, with
more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the
hair, out of the slough of nothingness. If any one should find out in
this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of "free
will" and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry
his "enlightenment" a step further, and also put out of his head the
contrary of this monstrous conception of "free will": I mean "non-free
will," which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect. One
should not wrongly MATERIALISE "cause" and "effect," as the natural
philosophers do (and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at
present), according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes
the cause press and push until it "effects" its end; one should use
"cause" and "effect" only as pure CONCEPTIONS, that is to say, as
conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual
understanding,--NOT for explanation. In "being-in-itself" there is
nothing of "casual-connection," of "necessity," or of "psychological
non-freedom"; there the effect does NOT follow the cause, there "law"
does not obtain. It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence,
reciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive,
and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-world,
as "being-in-itself," with things, we act once more as we have always
acted--MYTHOLOGICALLY. The "non-free will" is mythology; in real life
it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.--It is almost always
a symptom of what is lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every
"causal-connection" and "psychological necessity," manifests something
of compulsion, indigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom;
it is suspicious to have such feelings--the person betrays himself. And
in general, if I have observed correctly, the "non-freedom of the will"
is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but
always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner: some will not give up their
"responsibility," their belief in THEMSELVES, the personal right to
THEIR merits, at any price (the vain races belong to this class); others
on the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or blamed
for anything, and owing to an inward self-contempt, seek to GET OUT OF
THE BUSINESS, no matter how. The latter, when they write books, are
in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort of
socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise. And as a matter of
fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly
when it can pose as "la religion de la souffrance humaine"; that is ITS
"good taste."

22. Let me be pardoned, as an old philologist who cannot desist from
the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation, but
"Nature's conformity to law," of which you physicists talk so proudly,
as though--why, it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad
"philology." It is no matter of fact, no "text," but rather just a
naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning, with which
you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern
soul! "Everywhere equality before the law--Nature is not different in
that respect, nor better than we": a fine instance of secret motive,
in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and
autocratic--likewise a second and more refined atheism--is once more
disguised. "Ni dieu, ni maitre"--that, also, is what you want; and
therefore "Cheers for natural law!"--is it not so? But, as has been
said, that is interpretation, not text; and somebody might come along,
who, with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation, could read
out of the same "Nature," and with regard to the same phenomena, just
the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims
of power--an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and
unconditionalness of all "Will to Power" before your eyes, that almost
every word, and the word "tyranny" itself, would eventually seem
unsuitable, or like a weakening and softening metaphor--as being too
human; and who should, nevertheless, end by asserting the same about
this world as you do, namely, that it has a "necessary" and "calculable"
course, NOT, however, because laws obtain in it, but because they are
absolutely LACKING, and every power effects its ultimate consequences
every moment. Granted that this also is only interpretation--and you
will be eager enough to make this objection?--well, so much the better.

23. All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and
timidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths. In so far
as it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written,
evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent, it seems as if
nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the Morphology
and DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER, as I conceive of it.
The power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most
intellectual world, the world apparently most indifferent and
unprejudiced, and has obviously operated in an injurious, obstructive,
blinding, and distorting manner. A proper physio-psychology has to
contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator,
it has "the heart" against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal
conditionalness of the "good" and the "bad" impulses, causes (as
refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong and manly
conscience--still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good
impulses from bad ones. If, however, a person should regard even
the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and imperiousness
as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be present,
fundamentally and essentially, in the general economy of life (which
must, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further
developed), he will suffer from such a view of things as from
sea-sickness. And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest
and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous
knowledge, and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one
should keep away from it who CAN do so! On the other hand, if one has
once drifted hither with one's bark, well! very good! now let us set our
teeth firmly! let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm!
We sail away right OVER morality, we crush out, we destroy perhaps the
remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither--but
what do WE matter. Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight reveal
itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the psychologist who
thus "makes a sacrifice"--it is not the sacrifizio dell' intelletto,
on the contrary!--will at least be entitled to demand in return that
psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences,
for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist. For psychology
is once more the path to the fundamental problems.



CHAPTER II. THE FREE SPIRIT


24. O sancta simplicitiatas! In what strange simplification and
falsification man lives! One can never cease wondering when once one has
got eyes for beholding this marvel! How we have made everything around
us clear and free and easy and simple! how we have been able to give
our senses a passport to everything superficial, our thoughts a godlike
desire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences!--how from the beginning,
we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost
inconceivable freedom, thoughtlessness, imprudence, heartiness,
and gaiety--in order to enjoy life! And only on this solidified,
granite-like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself
hitherto, the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful
will, the will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue! Not as
its opposite, but--as its refinement! It is to be hoped, indeed, that
LANGUAGE, here as elsewhere, will not get over its awkwardness, and that
it will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees
and many refinements of gradation; it is equally to be hoped that the
incarnated Tartuffery of morals, which now belongs to our unconquerable
"flesh and blood," will turn the words round in the mouths of us
discerning ones. Here and there we understand it, and laugh at the way
in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this
SIMPLIFIED, thoroughly artificial, suitably imagined, and suitably
falsified world: at the way in which, whether it will or not, it loves
error, because, as living itself, it loves life!

25. After such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would fain be
heard; it appeals to the most serious minds. Take care, ye philosophers
and friends of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom! Of suffering "for the
truth's sake"! even in your own defense! It spoils all the innocence
and fine neutrality of your conscience; it makes you headstrong against
objections and red rags; it stupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when
in the struggle with danger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even
worse consequences of enmity, ye have at last to play your last card
as protectors of truth upon earth--as though "the Truth" were such an
innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors! and you of
all people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance, Messrs Loafers and
Cobweb-spinners of the spirit! Finally, ye know sufficiently well that
it cannot be of any consequence if YE just carry your point; ye know
that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point, and that there might
be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark
which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines (and
occasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn pantomime and
trumping games before accusers and law-courts! Rather go out of the way!
Flee into concealment! And have your masks and your ruses, that ye may
be mistaken for what you are, or somewhat feared! And pray, don't forget
the garden, the garden with golden trellis-work! And have people around
you who are as a garden--or as music on the waters at eventide, when
already the day becomes a memory. Choose the GOOD solitude, the free,
wanton, lightsome solitude, which also gives you the right still to
remain good in any sense whatsoever! How poisonous, how crafty, how bad,
does every long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means
of force! How PERSONAL does a long fear make one, a long watching
of enemies, of possible enemies! These pariahs of society, these
long-pursued, badly-persecuted ones--also the compulsory recluses, the
Spinozas or Giordano Brunos--always become in the end, even under the
most intellectual masquerade, and perhaps without being themselves aware
of it, refined vengeance-seekers and poison-Brewers (just lay bare
the foundation of Spinoza's ethics and theology!), not to speak of
the stupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfailing sign in a
philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him. The
martyrdom of the philosopher, his "sacrifice for the sake of truth,"
forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him;
and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity,
with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous
desire to see him also in his deterioration (deteriorated into a
"martyr," into a stage-and-tribune-bawler). Only, that it is necessary
with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any
case--merely a satyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the
continued proof that the long, real tragedy IS AT AN END, supposing that
every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.

26. Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy,
where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority--where he may
forget "men who are the rule," as their exception;--exclusive only of
the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger
instinct, as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense. Whoever, in
intercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the green
and grey colours of distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy,
gloominess, and solitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes;
supposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take all this burden
and disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it, and remains,
as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is then
certain: he was not made, he was not predestined for knowledge. For as
such, he would one day have to say to himself: "The devil take my good
taste! but 'the rule' is more interesting than the exception--than
myself, the exception!" And he would go DOWN, and above all, he would
go "inside." The long and serious study of the AVERAGE man--and
consequently much disguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad
intercourse (all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one's
equals):--that constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every
philosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing
part. If he is fortunate, however, as a favourite child of knowledge
should be, he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and
lighten his task; I mean so-called cynics, those who simply recognize
the animal, the commonplace and "the rule" in themselves, and at the
same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them
talk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSES--sometimes they
wallow, even in books, as on their own dung-hill. Cynicism is the only
form in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and the
higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism, and
congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before
him, or the scientific satyr speaks out. There are even cases where
enchantment mixes with the disgust--namely, where by a freak of nature,
genius is bound to some such indiscreet billy-goat and ape, as in the
case of the Abbe Galiani, the profoundest, acutest, and perhaps also
filthiest man of his century--he was far profounder than Voltaire, and
consequently also, a good deal more silent. It happens more frequently,
as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed on an ape's body, a
fine exceptional understanding in a base soul, an occurrence by no means
rare, especially among doctors and moral physiologists. And whenever
anyone speaks without bitterness, or rather quite innocently, of man
as a belly with two requirements, and a head with one; whenever any one
sees, seeks, and WANTS to see only hunger, sexual instinct, and vanity
as the real and only motives of human actions; in short, when any one
speaks "badly"--and not even "ill"--of man, then ought the lover of
knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he ought, in general,
to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation. For the
indignant man, and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with
his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, God, or society),
may indeed, morally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and
self-satisfied satyr, but in every other sense he is the more ordinary,
more indifferent, and less instructive case. And no one is such a LIAR
as the indignant man.

27. It is difficult to be understood, especially when one thinks and
lives gangasrotogati [Footnote: Like the river Ganges: presto.] among
those only who think and live otherwise--namely, kurmagati [Footnote:
Like the tortoise: lento.], or at best "froglike," mandeikagati
[Footnote: Like the frog: staccato.] (I do everything to be "difficultly
understood" myself!)--and one should be heartily grateful for the
good will to some refinement of interpretation. As regards "the good
friends," however, who are always too easy-going, and think that as
friends they have a right to ease, one does well at the very first to
grant them a play-ground and romping-place for misunderstanding--one can
thus laugh still; or get rid of them altogether, these good friends--and
laugh then also!

28. What is most difficult to render from one language into another
is the TEMPO of its style, which has its basis in the character of the
race, or to speak more physiologically, in the average TEMPO of the
assimilation of its nutriment. There are honestly meant translations,
which, as involuntary vulgarizations, are almost falsifications of the
original, merely because its lively and merry TEMPO (which overleaps and
obviates all dangers in word and expression) could not also be
rendered. A German is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language;
consequently also, as may be reasonably inferred, for many of the most
delightful and daring NUANCES of free, free-spirited thought. And just
as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience,
so Aristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him. Everything
ponderous, viscous, and pompously clumsy, all long-winded and wearying
species of style, are developed in profuse variety among Germans--pardon
me for stating the fact that even Goethe's prose, in its mixture of
stiffness and elegance, is no exception, as a reflection of the "good
old time" to which it belongs, and as an expression of German taste at a
time when there was still a "German taste," which was a rococo-taste
in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an exception, owing to his histrionic
nature, which understood much, and was versed in many things; he who was
not the translator of Bayle to no purpose, who took refuge willingly in
the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire, and still more willingly among the
Roman comedy-writers--Lessing loved also free-spiritism in the TEMPO,
and flight out of Germany. But how could the German language, even
in the prose of Lessing, imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli, who in his
"Principe" makes us breathe the dry, fine air of Florence, and cannot
help presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo,
perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he
ventures to present--long, heavy, difficult, dangerous thoughts, and
a TEMPO of the gallop, and of the best, wantonest humour? Finally, who
would venture on a German translation of Petronius, who, more than any
great musician hitherto, was a master of PRESTO in invention, ideas, and
words? What matter in the end about the swamps of the sick, evil world,
or of the "ancient world," when like him, one has the feet of a wind,
the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a wind, which makes
everything healthy, by making everything RUN! And with regard to
Aristophanes--that transfiguring, complementary genius, for whose
sake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed, provided one has
understood in its full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and
transfiguration; there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on
PLATO'S secrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit
fait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no
"Bible," nor anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic--but a book of
Aristophanes. How could even Plato have endured life--a Greek life which
he repudiated--without an Aristophanes!

29. It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a
privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the best
right, but without being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is probably
not only strong, but also daring beyond measure. He enters into a
labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself
already brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see
how and where he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal
by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it
is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor
sympathize with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot even go
back again to the sympathy of men!

30. Our deepest insights must--and should--appear as follies, and under
certain circumstances as crimes, when they come unauthorizedly to
the ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them. The
exoteric and the esoteric, as they were formerly distinguished by
philosophers--among the Indians, as among the Greeks, Persians, and
Mussulmans, in short, wherever people believed in gradations of rank and
NOT in equality and equal rights--are not so much in contradistinction
to one another in respect to the exoteric class, standing without, and
viewing, estimating, measuring, and judging from the outside, and not
from the inside; the more essential distinction is that the class in
question views things from below upwards--while the esoteric class views
things FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS. There are heights of the soul from which
tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically; and if all the
woe in the world were taken together, who would dare to decide whether
the sight of it would NECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy, and
thus to a doubling of the woe?... That which serves the higher class of
men for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an entirely
different and lower order of human beings. The virtues of the common
man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it might be
possible for a highly developed man, supposing him to degenerate and go
to ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for the sake of which he
would have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he
had sunk. There are books which have an inverse value for the soul and
the health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality, or the
higher and more powerful, make use of them. In the former case they are
dangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter case they are
herald-calls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery. Books for the
general reader are always ill-smelling books, the odour of paltry people
clings to them. Where the populace eat and drink, and even where they
reverence, it is accustomed to stink. One should not go into churches if
one wishes to breathe PURE air.

31. In our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art
of NUANCE, which is the best gain of life, and we have rightly to do
hard penance for having fallen upon men and things with Yea and Nay.
Everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes, THE TASTE FOR
THE UNCONDITIONAL, is cruelly befooled and abused, until a man learns
to introduce a little art into his sentiments, and prefers to try
conclusions with the artificial, as do the real artists of life. The
angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no
peace, until it has suitably falsified men and things, to be able
to vent its passion upon them: youth in itself even, is something
falsifying and deceptive. Later on, when the young soul, tortured by
continual disillusions, finally turns suspiciously against itself--still
ardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience: how
it upbraids itself, how impatiently it tears itself, how it revenges
itself for its long self-blinding, as though it had been a voluntary
blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one's
sentiments; one tortures one's enthusiasm with doubt, one feels even the
good conscience to be a danger, as if it were the self-concealment and
lassitude of a more refined uprightness; and above all, one espouses
upon principle the cause AGAINST "youth."--A decade later, and one
comprehends that all this was also still--youth!

32. Throughout the longest period of human history--one calls it the
prehistoric period--the value or non-value of an action was inferred
from its CONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not taken into
consideration, any more than its origin; but pretty much as in China at
present, where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to
its parents, the retro-operating power of success or failure was what
induced men to think well or ill of an action. Let us call this period
the PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative, "Know thyself!" was
then still unknown.--In the last ten thousand years, on the other hand,
on certain large portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far,
that one no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin,
decide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an
important refinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect
of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in "origin,"
the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as
the MORAL one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is thereby
made. Instead of the consequences, the origin--what an inversion
of perspective! And assuredly an inversion effected only after long
struggle and wavering! To be sure, an ominous new superstition, a
peculiar narrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy precisely
thereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite
sense possible, as origin out of an INTENTION; people were agreed in the
belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention.
The intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action:
under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been
bestowed, and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the
present day.--Is it not possible, however, that the necessity may now
have arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversing
and fundamental shifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness
and acuteness in man--is it not possible that we may be standing on
the threshold of a period which to begin with, would be distinguished
negatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays when, at least among us immoralists,
the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely
in that which is NOT INTENTIONAL, and that all its intentionalness, all
that is seen, sensible, or "sensed" in it, belongs to its surface or
skin--which, like every skin, betrays something, but CONCEALS still
more? In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom,
which first requires an explanation--a sign, moreover, which has too
many interpretations, and consequently hardly any meaning in itself
alone: that morality, in the sense in which it has been understood
hitherto, as intention-morality, has been a prejudice, perhaps a
prematureness or preliminariness, probably something of the same rank
as astrology and alchemy, but in any case something which must be
surmounted. The surmounting of morality, in a certain sense even the
self-mounting of morality--let that be the name for the long-secret
labour which has been reserved for the most refined, the most upright,
and also the most wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones
of the soul.

33. It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice for
one's neighbour, and all self-renunciation-morality, must be mercilessly
called to account, and brought to judgment; just as the aesthetics
of "disinterested contemplation," under which the emasculation of art
nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience.
There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments "for others"
and "NOT for myself," for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here,
and for one asking promptly: "Are they not perhaps--DECEPTIONS?"--That
they PLEASE--him who has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and also
the mere spectator--that is still no argument in their FAVOUR, but just
calls for caution. Let us therefore be cautious!

34. At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays,
seen from every position, the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which we
think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light
upon: we find proof after proof thereof, which would fain allure us into
surmises concerning a deceptive principle in the "nature of things."
He, however, who makes thinking itself, and consequently "the spirit,"
responsible for the falseness of the world--an honourable exit, which
every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of--he
who regards this world, including space, time, form, and movement, as
falsely DEDUCED, would have at least good reason in the end to become
distrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing upon
us the worst of scurvy tricks? and what guarantee would it give that
it would not continue to do what it has always been doing? In all
seriousness, the innocence of thinkers has something touching and
respect-inspiring in it, which even nowadays permits them to wait upon
consciousness with the request that it will give them HONEST answers:
for example, whether it be "real" or not, and why it keeps the outer
world so resolutely at a distance, and other questions of the same
description. The belief in "immediate certainties" is a MORAL NAIVETE
which does honour to us philosophers; but--we have now to cease being
"MERELY moral" men! Apart from morality, such belief is a folly which
does little honour to us! If in middle-class life an ever-ready distrust
is regarded as the sign of a "bad character," and consequently as an
imprudence, here among us, beyond the middle-class world and its Yeas
and Nays, what should prevent our being imprudent and saying: the
philosopher has at length a RIGHT to "bad character," as the being who
has hitherto been most befooled on earth--he is now under OBLIGATION
to distrustfulness, to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of
suspicion.--Forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of
expression; for I myself have long ago learned to think and estimate
differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I keep at
least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which
philosophers struggle against being deceived. Why NOT? It is nothing
more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; it
is, in fact, the worst proved supposition in the world. So much must be
conceded: there could have been no life at all except upon the basis
of perspective estimates and semblances; and if, with the virtuous
enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers, one wished to do away
altogether with the "seeming world"--well, granted that YOU could do
that,--at least nothing of your "truth" would thereby remain! Indeed,
what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an
essential opposition of "true" and "false"? Is it not enough to suppose
degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker shades and
tones of semblance--different valeurs, as the painters say? Why might
not the world WHICH CONCERNS US--be a fiction? And to any one who
suggested: "But to a fiction belongs an originator?"--might it not be
bluntly replied: WHY? May not this "belong" also belong to the fiction?
Is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the
subject, just as towards the predicate and object? Might not the
philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar? All respect
to governesses, but is it not time that philosophy should renounce
governess-faith?

35. O Voltaire! O humanity! O idiocy! There is something ticklish in
"the truth," and in the SEARCH for the truth; and if man goes about it
too humanely--"il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien"--I wager he
finds nothing!

36. Supposing that nothing else is "given" as real but our world of
desires and passions, that we cannot sink or rise to any other "reality"
but just that of our impulses--for thinking is only a relation of these
impulses to one another:--are we not permitted to make the attempt and
to ask the question whether this which is "given" does not SUFFICE, by
means of our counterparts, for the understanding even of the so-called
mechanical (or "material") world? I do not mean as an illusion, a
"semblance," a "representation" (in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian
sense), but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions
themselves--as a more primitive form of the world of emotions, in
which everything still lies locked in a mighty unity, which afterwards
branches off and develops itself in organic processes (naturally also,
refines and debilitates)--as a kind of instinctive life in which all
organic functions, including self-regulation, assimilation, nutrition,
secretion, and change of matter, are still synthetically united with
one another--as a PRIMARY FORM of life?--In the end, it is not only
permitted to make this attempt, it is commanded by the conscience of
LOGICAL METHOD. Not to assume several kinds of causality, so long as
the attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its
furthest extent (to absurdity, if I may be allowed to say so): that is
a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays--it follows
"from its definition," as mathematicians say. The question is ultimately
whether we really recognize the will as OPERATING, whether we believe in
the causality of the will; if we do so--and fundamentally our belief IN
THIS is just our belief in causality itself--we MUST make the attempt
to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality.
"Will" can naturally only operate on "will"--and not on "matter" (not
on "nerves," for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be
hazarded, whether will does not operate on will wherever "effects"
are recognized--and whether all mechanical action, inasmuch as a power
operates therein, is not just the power of will, the effect of will.
Granted, finally, that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive
life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of
will--namely, the Will to Power, as my thesis puts it; granted that all
organic functions could be traced back to this Will to Power, and that
the solution of the problem of generation and nutrition--it is one
problem--could also be found therein: one would thus have acquired the
right to define ALL active force unequivocally as WILL TO POWER. The
world seen from within, the world defined and designated according to
its "intelligible character"--it would simply be "Will to Power," and
nothing else.

37. "What? Does not that mean in popular language: God is disproved, but
not the devil?"--On the contrary! On the contrary, my friends! And who
the devil also compels you to speak popularly!

38. As happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times with
the French Revolution (that terrible farce, quite superfluous when
judged close at hand, into which, however, the noble and visionary
spectators of all Europe have interpreted from a distance their own
indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately, UNTIL THE TEXT HAS
DISAPPEARED UNDER THE INTERPRETATION), so a noble posterity might once
more misunderstand the whole of the past, and perhaps only thereby make
ITS aspect endurable.--Or rather, has not this already happened? Have
not we ourselves been--that "noble posterity"? And, in so far as we now
comprehend this, is it not--thereby already past?

39. Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely because
it makes people happy or virtuous--excepting, perhaps, the amiable
"Idealists," who are enthusiastic about the good, true, and beautiful,
and let all kinds of motley, coarse, and good-natured desirabilities
swim about promiscuously in their pond. Happiness and virtue are no
arguments. It is willingly forgotten, however, even on the part of
thoughtful minds, that to make unhappy and to make bad are just as
little counter-arguments. A thing could be TRUE, although it were in
the highest degree injurious and dangerous; indeed, the fundamental
constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full
knowledge of it--so that the strength of a mind might be measured by
the amount of "truth" it could endure--or to speak more plainly, by the
extent to which it REQUIRED truth attenuated, veiled, sweetened, damped,
and falsified. But there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain
PORTIONS of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably
situated and have a greater likelihood of success; not to speak of the
wicked who are happy--a species about whom moralists are silent. Perhaps
severity and craft are more favourable conditions for the development of
strong, independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle, refined,
yielding good-nature, and habit of taking things easily, which are
prized, and rightly prized in a learned man. Presupposing always,
to begin with, that the term "philosopher" be not confined to the
philosopher who writes books, or even introduces HIS philosophy into
books!--Stendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the
free-spirited philosopher, which for the sake of German taste I will
not omit to underline--for it is OPPOSED to German taste. "Pour etre
bon philosophe," says this last great psychologist, "il faut etre sec,
clair, sans illusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du
caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie, c'est-a-dire
pour voir clair dans ce qui est."

40. Everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest things
have a hatred even of figure and likeness. Should not the CONTRARY only
be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go about in? A question
worth asking!--it would be strange if some mystic has not already
ventured on the same kind of thing. There are proceedings of such a
delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness
and make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love and of an
extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take
a stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby obscures his
recollection. Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, in
order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret:
shame is inventive. They are not the worst things of which one is
most ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask--there is so much
goodness in craft. I could imagine that a man with something costly and
fragile to conceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like
an old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of his shame
requiring it to be so. A man who has depths in his shame meets his
destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach,
and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate
friends may be ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their
eyes, and equally so his regained security. Such a hidden nature,
which instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is
inexhaustible in evasion of communication, DESIRES and insists that a
mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his
friends; and supposing he does not desire it, his eyes will some day be
opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there--and
that it is well to be so. Every profound spirit needs a mask; nay, more,
around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask, owing to
the constantly false, that is to say, SUPERFICIAL interpretation
of every word he utters, every step he takes, every sign of life he
manifests.

41. One must subject oneself to one's own tests that one is destined
for independence and command, and do so at the right time. One must not
avoid one's tests, although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous
game one can play, and are in the end tests made only before ourselves
and before no other judge. Not to cleave to any person, be it even the
dearest--every person is a prison and also a recess. Not to cleave to
a fatherland, be it even the most suffering and necessitous--it is even
less difficult to detach one's heart from a victorious fatherland. Not
to cleave to a sympathy, be it even for higher men, into whose peculiar
torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight. Not to cleave
to a science, though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveries,
apparently specially reserved for us. Not to cleave to one's own
liberation, to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird, which
always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it--the
danger of the flier. Not to cleave to our own virtues, nor become as
a whole a victim to any of our specialties, to our "hospitality" for
instance, which is the danger of dangers for highly developed
and wealthy souls, who deal prodigally, almost indifferently with
themselves, and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes
a vice. One must know how TO CONSERVE ONESELF--the best test of
independence.

42. A new order of philosophers is appearing; I shall venture to baptize
them by a name not without danger. As far as I understand them, as far
as they allow themselves to be understood--for it is their nature to
WISH to remain something of a puzzle--these philosophers of the
future might rightly, perhaps also wrongly, claim to be designated as
"tempters." This name itself is after all only an attempt, or, if it be
preferred, a temptation.

43. Will they be new friends of "truth," these coming philosophers? Very
probably, for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths. But
assuredly they will not be dogmatists. It must be contrary to their
pride, and also contrary to their taste, that their truth should still
be truth for every one--that which has hitherto been the secret wish
and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts. "My opinion is MY opinion:
another person has not easily a right to it"--such a philosopher of the
future will say, perhaps. One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to
agree with many people. "Good" is no longer good when one's neighbour
takes it into his mouth. And how could there be a "common good"! The
expression contradicts itself; that which can be common is always of
small value. In the end things must be as they are and have always
been--the great things remain for the great, the abysses for the
profound, the delicacies and thrills for the refined, and, to sum up
shortly, everything rare for the rare.


44. Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free, VERY
free spirits, these philosophers of the future--as certainly also they
will not be merely free spirits, but something more, higher, greater,
and fundamentally different, which does not wish to be misunderstood and
mistaken? But while I say this, I feel under OBLIGATION almost as much
to them as to ourselves (we free spirits who are their heralds and
forerunners), to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old
prejudice and misunderstanding, which, like a fog, has too long made the
conception of "free spirit" obscure. In every country of Europe, and the
same in America, there is at present something which makes an abuse of
this name a very narrow, prepossessed, enchained class of spirits,
who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts
prompt--not to mention that in respect to the NEW philosophers who are
appearing, they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors.
Briefly and regrettably, they belong to the LEVELLERS, these wrongly
named "free spirits"--as glib-tongued and scribe-fingered slaves of
the democratic taste and its "modern ideas" all of them men without
solitude, without personal solitude, blunt honest fellows to whom
neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied, only, they
are not free, and are ludicrously superficial, especially in their
innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human misery and
failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existed--a notion
which happily inverts the truth entirely! What they would fain attain
with all their strength, is the universal, green-meadow happiness of the
herd, together with security, safety, comfort, and alleviation of life
for every one, their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrines
are called "Equality of Rights" and "Sympathy with All Sufferers"--and
suffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must be
DONE AWAY WITH. We opposite ones, however, who have opened our eye and
conscience to the question how and where the plant "man" has hitherto
grown most vigorously, believe that this has always taken place under
the opposite conditions, that for this end the dangerousness of his
situation had to be increased enormously, his inventive faculty and
dissembling power (his "spirit") had to develop into subtlety and daring
under long oppression and compulsion, and his Will to Life had to be
increased to the unconditioned Will to Power--we believe that severity,
violence, slavery, danger in the street and in the heart, secrecy,
stoicism, tempter's art and devilry of every kind,--that everything
wicked, terrible, tyrannical, predatory, and serpentine in man, serves
as well for the elevation of the human species as its opposite--we do
not even say enough when we only say THIS MUCH, and in any case we
find ourselves here, both with our speech and our silence, at the OTHER
extreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability, as their
antipodes perhaps? What wonder that we "free spirits" are not exactly
the most communicative spirits? that we do not wish to betray in every
respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from, and WHERE perhaps it will
then be driven? And as to the import of the dangerous formula, "Beyond
Good and Evil," with which we at least avoid confusion, we ARE something
else than "libres-penseurs," "liben pensatori" "free-thinkers,"
and whatever these honest advocates of "modern ideas" like to call
themselves. Having been at home, or at least guests, in many realms of
the spirit, having escaped again and again from the gloomy, agreeable
nooks in which preferences and prejudices, youth, origin, the accident
of men and books, or even the weariness of travel seemed to confine us,
full of malice against the seductions of dependency which he concealed
in honours, money, positions, or exaltation of the senses, grateful even
for distress and the vicissitudes of illness, because they always free
us from some rule, and its "prejudice," grateful to the God, devil,
sheep, and worm in us, inquisitive to a fault, investigators to the
point of cruelty, with unhesitating fingers for the intangible, with
teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible, ready for any business
that requires sagacity and acute senses, ready for every adventure,
owing to an excess of "free will", with anterior and posterior souls,
into the ultimate intentions of which it is difficult to pry, with
foregrounds and backgrounds to the end of which no foot may run, hidden
ones under the mantles of light, appropriators, although we resemble
heirs and spendthrifts, arrangers and collectors from morning till
night, misers of our wealth and our full-crammed drawers, economical
in learning and forgetting, inventive in scheming, sometimes proud of
tables of categories, sometimes pedants, sometimes night-owls of
work even in full day, yea, if necessary, even scarecrows--and it is
necessary nowadays, that is to say, inasmuch as we are the born, sworn,
jealous friends of SOLITUDE, of our own profoundest midnight and midday
solitude--such kind of men are we, we free spirits! And perhaps ye are
also something of the same kind, ye coming ones? ye NEW philosophers?



CHAPTER III. THE RELIGIOUS MOOD


45. The human soul and its limits, the range of man's inner experiences
hitherto attained, the heights, depths, and distances of these
experiences, the entire history of the soul UP TO THE PRESENT TIME,
and its still unexhausted possibilities: this is the preordained
hunting-domain for a born psychologist and lover of a "big hunt". But
how often must he say despairingly to himself: "A single individual!
alas, only a single individual! and this great forest, this virgin
forest!" So he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistants,
and fine trained hounds, that he could send into the history of the
human soul, to drive HIS game together. In vain: again and again he
experiences, profoundly and bitterly, how difficult it is to find
assistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite his
curiosity. The evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous
hunting-domains, where courage, sagacity, and subtlety in every sense
are required, is that they are no longer serviceable just when the "BIG
hunt," and also the great danger commences,--it is precisely then that
they lose their keen eye and nose. In order, for instance, to divine and
determine what sort of history the problem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCE
has hitherto had in the souls of homines religiosi, a person would
perhaps himself have to possess as profound, as bruised, as immense an
experience as the intellectual conscience of Pascal; and then he would
still require that wide-spread heaven of clear, wicked spirituality,
which, from above, would be able to oversee, arrange, and effectively
formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences.--But who
could do me this service! And who would have time to wait for such
servants!--they evidently appear too rarely, they are so improbable at
all times! Eventually one must do everything ONESELF in order to know
something; which means that one has MUCH to do!--But a curiosity like
mine is once for all the most agreeable of vices--pardon me! I mean to
say that the love of truth has its reward in heaven, and already upon
earth.

46. Faith, such as early Christianity desired, and not infrequently
achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly free-spirited world,
which had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behind
it and in it, counting besides the education in tolerance which
the Imperium Romanum gave--this faith is NOT that sincere, austere
slave-faith by which perhaps a Luther or a Cromwell, or some other
northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his God and
Christianity, it is much rather the faith of Pascal, which resembles in
a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reason--a tough, long-lived,
worm-like reason, which is not to be slain at once and with a single
blow. The Christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the sacrifice
of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of spirit, it is at
the same time subjection, self-derision, and self-mutilation. There is
cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in this faith, which is adapted to a
tender, many-sided, and very fastidious conscience, it takes for granted
that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL, that all the
past and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum, in
the form of which "faith" comes to it. Modern men, with their obtuseness
as regards all Christian nomenclature, have no longer the sense for the
terribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste by
the paradox of the formula, "God on the Cross". Hitherto there had never
and nowhere been such boldness in inversion, nor anything at once so
dreadful, questioning, and questionable as this formula: it promised a
transvaluation of all ancient values--It was the Orient, the PROFOUND
Orient, it was the Oriental slave who thus took revenge on Rome and its
noble, light-minded toleration, on the Roman "Catholicism" of non-faith,
and it was always not the faith, but the freedom from the faith, the
half-stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith,
which made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against
them. "Enlightenment" causes revolt, for the slave desires the
unconditioned, he understands nothing but the tyrannous, even in morals,
he loves as he hates, without NUANCE, to the very depths, to the point
of pain, to the point of sickness--his many HIDDEN sufferings make
him revolt against the noble taste which seems to DENY suffering. The
skepticism with regard to suffering, fundamentally only an attitude of
aristocratic morality, was not the least of the causes, also, of the
last great slave-insurrection which began with the French Revolution.

47. Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so far,
we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen:
solitude, fasting, and sexual abstinence--but without its being possible
to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect, or IF
any relation at all of cause and effect exists there. This latter doubt
is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among
savage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden and
excessive sensuality, which then with equal suddenness transforms into
penitential paroxysms, world-renunciation, and will-renunciation, both
symptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy? But nowhere is it
MORE obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has there
grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition, no other type seems to
have been more interesting to men and even to philosophers--perhaps it
is time to become just a little indifferent here, to learn caution, or,
better still, to look AWAY, TO GO AWAY--Yet in the background of the
most recent philosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the
problem in itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the religious
crisis and awakening. How is the negation of will POSSIBLE? how is the
saint possible?--that seems to have been the very question with which
Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher. And thus it was a
genuine Schopenhauerian consequence, that his most convinced adherent
(perhaps also his last, as far as Germany is concerned), namely, Richard
Wagner, should bring his own life-work to an end just here, and should
finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage as Kundry,
type vecu, and as it loved and lived, at the very time that the
mad-doctors in almost all European countries had an opportunity to study
the type close at hand, wherever the religious neurosis--or as I call
it, "the religious mood"--made its latest epidemical outbreak and
display as the "Salvation Army"--If it be a question, however, as to
what has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages,
and even to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the saint, it
is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein--namely, the
immediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES, of states of the soul regarded as
morally antithetical: it was believed here to be self-evident that
a "bad man" was all at once turned into a "saint," a good man. The
hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point, is it not
possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed
itself under the dominion of morals, because it BELIEVED in oppositions
of moral values, and saw, read, and INTERPRETED these oppositions
into the text and facts of the case? What? "Miracle" only an error of
interpretation? A lack of philology?

48. It seems that the Latin races are far more deeply attached to their
Catholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity generally, and
that consequently unbelief in Catholic countries means something quite
different from what it does among Protestants--namely, a sort of revolt
against the spirit of the race, while with us it is rather a return to
the spirit (or non-spirit) of the race.

We Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races, even
as regards our talents for religion--we have POOR talents for it. One
may make an exception in the case of the Celts, who have theretofore
furnished also the best soil for Christian infection in the North: the
Christian ideal blossomed forth in France as much as ever the pale sun
of the north would allow it. How strangely pious for our taste are still
these later French skeptics, whenever there is any Celtic blood in their
origin! How Catholic, how un-German does Auguste Comte's Sociology
seem to us, with the Roman logic of its instincts! How Jesuitical, that
amiable and shrewd cicerone of Port Royal, Sainte-Beuve, in spite of all
his hostility to Jesuits! And even Ernest Renan: how inaccessible to
us Northerners does the language of such a Renan appear, in whom
every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refined
voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance! Let us repeat
after him these fine sentences--and what wickedness and haughtiness is
immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less beautiful but
harder souls, that is to say, in our more German souls!--"DISONS DONC
HARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT DE L'HOMME NORMAL, QUE L'HOMME
EST LE PLUS DANS LE VRAI QUANT IL EST LE PLUS RELIGIEUX ET LE PLUS
ASSURE D'UNE DESTINEE INFINIE.... C'EST QUAND IL EST BON QU'IL VEUT QUE
LA VIRTU CORRESPONDE A UN ORDER ETERNAL, C'EST QUAND IL CONTEMPLE LES
CHOSES D'UNE MANIERE DESINTERESSEE QU'IL TROUVE LA MORT REVOLTANTE ET
ABSURDE. COMMENT NE PAS SUPPOSER QUE C'EST DANS CES MOMENTS-LA, QUE
L'HOMME VOIT LE MIEUX?"... These sentences are so extremely ANTIPODAL
to my ears and habits of thought, that in my first impulse of rage
on finding them, I wrote on the margin, "LA NIAISERIE RELIGIEUSE PAR
EXCELLENCE!"--until in my later rage I even took a fancy to them, these
sentences with their truth absolutely inverted! It is so nice and such a
distinction to have one's own antipodes!

49. That which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancient
Greeks is the irrestrainable stream of GRATITUDE which it pours
forth--it is a very superior kind of man who takes SUCH an attitude
towards nature and life.--Later on, when the populace got the upper hand
in Greece, FEAR became rampant also in religion; and Christianity was
preparing itself.

50. The passion for God: there are churlish, honest-hearted, and
importunate kinds of it, like that of Luther--the whole of Protestantism
lacks the southern DELICATEZZA. There is an Oriental exaltation of the
mind in it, like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as
in the case of St. Augustine, for instance, who lacks in an offensive
manner, all nobility in bearing and desires. There is a feminine
tenderness and sensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously longs
for a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA, as in the case of Madame de Guyon. In
many cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a girl's
or youth's puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid,
also as her last ambition. The Church has frequently canonized the woman
in such a case.

51. The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before
the saint, as the enigma of self-subjugation and utter voluntary
privation--why did they thus bow? They divined in him--and as it were
behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearance--the
superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation; the
strength of will, in which they recognized their own strength and
love of power, and knew how to honour it: they honoured something
in themselves when they honoured the saint. In addition to this, the
contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion: such an
enormity of self-negation and anti-naturalness will not have been
coveted for nothing--they have said, inquiringly. There is perhaps a
reason for it, some very great danger, about which the ascetic might
wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors and
visitors? In a word, the mighty ones of the world learned to have a new
fear before him, they divined a new power, a strange, still unconquered
enemy:--it was the "Will to Power" which obliged them to halt before the
saint. They had to question him.

52. In the Jewish "Old Testament," the book of divine justice, there are
men, things, and sayings on such an immense scale, that Greek and Indian
literature has nothing to compare with it. One stands with fear and
reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly, and
one has sad thoughts about old Asia and its little out-pushed peninsula
Europe, which would like, by all means, to figure before Asia as the
"Progress of Mankind." To be sure, he who is himself only a slender,
tame house-animal, and knows only the wants of a house-animal (like
our cultured people of today, including the Christians of "cultured"
Christianity), need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins--the
taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to "great" and
"small": perhaps he will find that the New Testament, the book of grace,
still appeals more to his heart (there is much of the odour of the
genuine, tender, stupid beadsman and petty soul in it). To have bound
up this New Testament (a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect) along
with the Old Testament into one book, as the "Bible," as "The Book in
Itself," is perhaps the greatest audacity and "sin against the Spirit"
which literary Europe has upon its conscience.

53. Why Atheism nowadays? "The father" in God is thoroughly refuted;
equally so "the judge," "the rewarder." Also his "free will": he does
not hear--and even if he did, he would not know how to help. The worst
is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly; is he
uncertain?--This is what I have made out (by questioning and listening
at a variety of conversations) to be the cause of the decline of
European theism; it appears to me that though the religious instinct is
in vigorous growth,--it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound
distrust.

54. What does all modern philosophy mainly do? Since Descartes--and
indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure--an
ATTENTAT has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old
conception of the soul, under the guise of a criticism of the subject
and predicate conception--that is to say, an ATTENTAT on the
fundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine. Modern philosophy,
as epistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIAN,
although (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious.
Formerly, in effect, one believed in "the soul" as one believed in
grammar and the grammatical subject: one said, "I" is the condition,
"think" is the predicate and is conditioned--to think is an activity for
which one MUST suppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then made,
with marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could not get out
of this net,--to see if the opposite was not perhaps true: "think" the
condition, and "I" the conditioned; "I," therefore, only a synthesis
which has been MADE by thinking itself. KANT really wished to prove
that, starting from the subject, the subject could not be proved--nor
the object either: the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the
subject, and therefore of "the soul," may not always have been strange
to him,--the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the
Vedanta philosophy.

55. There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, with many rounds; but
three of these are the most important. Once on a time men sacrificed
human beings to their God, and perhaps just those they loved the
best--to this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitive
religions, and also the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in the
Mithra-Grotto on the Island of Capri, that most terrible of all Roman
anachronisms. Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed
to their God the strongest instincts they possessed, their "nature";
THIS festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and
"anti-natural" fanatics. Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed?
Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything
comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in
future blessedness and justice? Was it not necessary to sacrifice God
himself, and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone, stupidity,
gravity, fate, nothingness? To sacrifice God for nothingness--this
paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the
rising generation; we all know something thereof already.

56. Whoever, like myself, prompted by some enigmatical desire, has long
endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it
from the half-Christian, half-German narrowness and stupidity in which
it has finally presented itself to this century, namely, in the form of
Schopenhauer's philosophy; whoever, with an Asiatic and super-Asiatic
eye, has actually looked inside, and into the most world-renouncing of
all possible modes of thought--beyond good and evil, and no longer
like Buddha and Schopenhauer, under the dominion and delusion of
morality,--whoever has done this, has perhaps just thereby, without
really desiring it, opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal: the
ideal of the most world-approving, exuberant, and vivacious man, who has
not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and
is, but wishes to have it again AS IT WAS AND IS, for all eternity,
insatiably calling out da capo, not only to himself, but to the whole
piece and play; and not only the play, but actually to him who requires
the play--and makes it necessary; because he always requires
himself anew--and makes himself necessary.--What? And this would not
be--circulus vitiosus deus?

57. The distance, and as it were the space around man, grows with the
strength of his intellectual vision and insight: his world becomes
profounder; new stars, new enigmas, and notions are ever coming into
view. Perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised
its acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercise,
something of a game, something for children and childish minds. Perhaps
the most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting and
suffering, the conceptions "God" and "sin," will one day seem to us of
no more importance than a child's plaything or a child's pain seems to
an old man;--and perhaps another plaything and another pain will then
be necessary once more for "the old man"--always childish enough, an
eternal child!

58. Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or
semi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for its
favourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for its soft
placidity called "prayer," the state of perpetual readiness for the
"coming of God"), I mean the idleness with a good conscience, the
idleness of olden times and of blood, to which the aristocratic
sentiment that work is DISHONOURING--that it vulgarizes body and
soul--is not quite unfamiliar? And that consequently the modern, noisy,
time-engrossing, conceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates
and prepares for "unbelief" more than anything else? Among these, for
instance, who are at present living apart from religion in Germany, I
find "free-thinkers" of diversified species and origin, but above all
a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation
has dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know what
purpose religions serve, and only note their existence in the world
with a kind of dull astonishment. They feel themselves already fully
occupied, these good people, be it by their business or by their
pleasures, not to mention the "Fatherland," and the newspapers, and
their "family duties"; it seems that they have no time whatever left
for religion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a
question of a new business or a new pleasure--for it is impossible, they
say to themselves, that people should go to church merely to spoil
their tempers. They are by no means enemies of religious customs;
should certain circumstances, State affairs perhaps, require their
participation in such customs, they do what is required, as so many
things are done--with a patient and unassuming seriousness, and without
much curiosity or discomfort;--they live too much apart and outside
to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matters. Among
those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of
German Protestants of the middle classes, especially in the great
laborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laborious
scholars, and the entire University personnel (with the exception of
the theologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives
psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). On the part of
pious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea of HOW
MUCH good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a
German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his whole
profession (and as I have said, his whole workmanlike laboriousness, to
which he is compelled by his modern conscience) inclines him to a
lofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion, with which is
occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the "uncleanliness" of spirit
which he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong
to the Church. It is only with the help of history (NOT through his own
personal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing
himself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain timid deference
in presence of religions; but even when his sentiments have reached the
stage of gratitude towards them, he has not personally advanced one
step nearer to that which still maintains itself as Church or as piety;
perhaps even the contrary. The practical indifference to religious
matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up, usually
sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness, which
shuns contact with religious men and things; and it may be just the
depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the
delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it.--Every age has
its own divine type of naivete, for the discovery of which other ages
may envy it: and how much naivete--adorable, childlike, and boundlessly
foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in
his superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the
unsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the
religious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and
ABOVE which he himself has developed--he, the little arrogant dwarf
and mob-man, the sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of "ideas," of
"modern ideas"!

59. Whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what
wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. It is their
preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty, lightsome, and
false. Here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration
of "pure forms" in philosophers as well as in artists: it is not to be
doubted that whoever has NEED of the cult of the superficial to that
extent, has at one time or another made an unlucky dive BENEATH it.
Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt
children, the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying
to FALSIFY its image (as if taking wearisome revenge on it), one might
guess to what degree life has disgusted them, by the extent to which
they wish to see its image falsified, attenuated, ultrified, and
deified,--one might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists, as
their HIGHEST rank. It is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable
pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a
religious interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct which
divines that truth might be attained TOO soon, before man has become
strong enough, hard enough, artist enough.... Piety, the "Life in God,"
regarded in this light, would appear as the most elaborate and
ultimate product of the FEAR of truth, as artist-adoration
and artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of all
falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth at
any price. Perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means of
beautifying man than piety, by means of it man can become so artful, so
superficial, so iridescent, and so good, that his appearance no longer
offends.

60. To love mankind FOR GOD'S SAKE--this has so far been the noblest and
remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained. That love to mankind,
without any redeeming intention in the background, is only an ADDITIONAL
folly and brutishness, that the inclination to this love has first to
get its proportion, its delicacy, its gram of salt and sprinkling
of ambergris from a higher inclination--whoever first perceived
and "experienced" this, however his tongue may have stammered as it
attempted to express such a delicate matter, let him for all time be
holy and respected, as the man who has so far flown highest and gone
astray in the finest fashion!

61. The philosopher, as WE free spirits understand him--as the man of
the greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for the general
development of mankind,--will use religion for his disciplining and
educating work, just as he will use the contemporary political
and economic conditions. The selecting and disciplining
influence--destructive, as well as creative and fashioning--which can be
exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied, according to the
sort of people placed under its spell and protection. For those who are
strong and independent, destined and trained to command, in whom the
judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion is
an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of
authority--as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common,
betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter,
their inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience. And in the
case of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue of superior
spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative
life, reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government
(over chosen disciples or members of an order), religion itself may
be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of
managing GROSSER affairs, and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE
filth of all political agitation. The Brahmins, for instance, understood
this fact. With the help of a religious organization, they secured to
themselves the power of nominating kings for the people, while their
sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside, as men with a higher
and super-regal mission. At the same time religion gives inducement and
opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future
ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes, in which,
through fortunate marriage customs, volitional power and delight in
self-control are on the increase. To them religion offers sufficient
incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality, and to
experience the sentiments of authoritative self-control, of silence, and
of solitude. Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of
educating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary
baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy. And finally, to
ordinary men, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and
general utility, and are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives
invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition, peace of heart,
ennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy,
with something of transfiguration and embellishment, something of
justification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all
the semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion, together with the
religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually
harassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it
operates upon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon
sufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner,
almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and
vindicating it. There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity
and Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate
themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby
to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it
difficult enough to live--this very difficulty being necessary.

62. To be sure--to make also the bad counter-reckoning against such
religions, and to bring to light their secret dangers--the cost is
always excessive and terrible when religions do NOT operate as an
educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher, but
rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY, when they wish to be the final end,
and not a means along with other means. Among men, as among all other
animals, there is a surplus of defective, diseased, degenerating,
infirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the successful cases,
among men also, are always the exception; and in view of the fact that
man is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the rare
exception. But worse still. The higher the type a man represents, the
greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED; the accidental, the
law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind, manifests
itself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of
men, the conditions of whose lives are delicate, diverse, and difficult
to determine. What, then, is the attitude of the two greatest religions
above-mentioned to the SURPLUS of failures in life? They endeavour
to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the
religions FOR SUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle;
they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a
disease, and they would fain treat every other experience of life as
false and impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent and
preservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied,
and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of
man), the hitherto PARAMOUNT religions--to give a general appreciation
of them--are among the principal causes which have kept the type of
"man" upon a lower level--they have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD
HAVE PERISHED. One has to thank them for invaluable services; and who is
sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation
of all that the "spiritual men" of Christianity have done for Europe
hitherto! But when they had given comfort to the sufferers, courage to
the oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to the helpless,
and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual
penitentiaries the broken-hearted and distracted: what else had they
to do in order to work systematically in that fashion, and with a good
conscience, for the preservation of all the sick and suffering, which
means, in deed and in truth, to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE
EUROPEAN RACE? To REVERSE all estimates of value--THAT is what they
had to do! And to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes, to cast
suspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything autonomous,
manly, conquering, and imperious--all instincts which are natural to the
highest and most successful type of "man"--into uncertainty, distress
of conscience, and self-destruction; forsooth, to invert all love of the
earthly and of supremacy over the earth, into hatred of the earth and
earthly things--THAT is the task the Church imposed on itself, and
was obliged to impose, until, according to its standard of value,
"unworldliness," "unsensuousness," and "higher man" fused into one
sentiment. If one could observe the strangely painful, equally coarse
and refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and
impartial eye of an Epicurean god, I should think one would never cease
marvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that some single will
has ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a SUBLIME
ABORTION of man? He, however, who, with opposite requirements (no longer
Epicurean) and with some divine hammer in his hand, could approach this
almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind, as exemplified in
the European Christian (Pascal, for instance), would he not have to
cry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: "Oh, you bunglers, presumptuous
pitiful bunglers, what have you done! Was that a work for your hands?
How you have hacked and botched my finest stone! What have you presumed
to do!"--I should say that Christianity has hitherto been the most
portentous of presumptions. Men, not great enough, nor hard enough,
to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men,
not sufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime
self-constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and
perishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the radically
different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from
man:--SUCH men, with their "equality before God," have hitherto swayed
the destiny of Europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost ludicrous species
has been produced, a gregarious animal, something obliging, sickly,
mediocre, the European of the present day.



CHAPTER IV. APOPHTHEGMS AND INTERLUDES


63. He who is a thorough teacher takes things seriously--and even
himself--only in relation to his pupils.

64. "Knowledge for its own sake"--that is the last snare laid by
morality: we are thereby completely entangled in morals once more.

65. The charm of knowledge would be small, were it not so much shame has
to be overcome on the way to it.

65A. We are most dishonourable towards our God: he is not PERMITTED to
sin.

66. The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed,
deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men.

67. Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense
of all others. Love to God also!

68. "I did that," says my memory. "I could not have done that," says my
pride, and remains inexorable. Eventually--the memory yields.

69. One has regarded life carelessly, if one has failed to see the hand
that--kills with leniency.

70. If a man has character, he has also his typical experience, which
always recurs.

71. THE SAGE AS ASTRONOMER.--So long as thou feelest the stars as an
"above thee," thou lackest the eye of the discerning one.

72. It is not the strength, but the duration of great sentiments that
makes great men.

73. He who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it.

73A. Many a peacock hides his tail from every eye--and calls it his
pride.

74. A man of genius is unbearable, unless he possess at least two things
besides: gratitude and purity.

75. The degree and nature of a man's sensuality extends to the highest
altitudes of his spirit.

76. Under peaceful conditions the militant man attacks himself.

77. With his principles a man seeks either to dominate, or justify,
or honour, or reproach, or conceal his habits: two men with the same
principles probably seek fundamentally different ends therewith.

78. He who despises himself, nevertheless esteems himself thereby, as a
despiser.

79. A soul which knows that it is loved, but does not itself love,
betrays its sediment: its dregs come up.

80. A thing that is explained ceases to concern us--What did the God
mean who gave the advice, "Know thyself!" Did it perhaps imply "Cease to
be concerned about thyself! become objective!"--And Socrates?--And the
"scientific man"?

81. It is terrible to die of thirst at sea. Is it necessary that you
should so salt your truth that it will no longer--quench thirst?

82. "Sympathy for all"--would be harshness and tyranny for THEE, my good
neighbour.

83. INSTINCT--When the house is on fire one forgets even the
dinner--Yes, but one recovers it from among the ashes.

84. Woman learns how to hate in proportion as she--forgets how to charm.

85. The same emotions are in man and woman, but in different TEMPO, on
that account man and woman never cease to misunderstand each other.

86. In the background of all their personal vanity, women themselves
have still their impersonal scorn--for "woman".

87. FETTERED HEART, FREE SPIRIT--When one firmly fetters one's heart
and keeps it prisoner, one can allow one's spirit many liberties: I said
this once before But people do not believe it when I say so, unless they
know it already.

88. One begins to distrust very clever persons when they become
embarrassed.

89. Dreadful experiences raise the question whether he who experiences
them is not something dreadful also.

90. Heavy, melancholy men turn lighter, and come temporarily to their
surface, precisely by that which makes others heavy--by hatred and love.

91. So cold, so icy, that one burns one's finger at the touch of him!
Every hand that lays hold of him shrinks back!--And for that very reason
many think him red-hot.

92. Who has not, at one time or another--sacrificed himself for the sake
of his good name?

93. In affability there is no hatred of men, but precisely on that
account a great deal too much contempt of men.

94. The maturity of man--that means, to have reacquired the seriousness
that one had as a child at play.

95. To be ashamed of one's immorality is a step on the ladder at the end
of which one is ashamed also of one's morality.

96. One should part from life as Ulysses parted from Nausicaa--blessing
it rather than in love with it.

97. What? A great man? I always see merely the play-actor of his own
ideal.

98. When one trains one's conscience, it kisses one while it bites.

99. THE DISAPPOINTED ONE SPEAKS--"I listened for the echo and I heard
only praise."

100. We all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are, we thus
relax ourselves away from our fellows.

101. A discerning one might easily regard himself at present as the
animalization of God.

102. Discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the lover with
regard to the beloved. "What! She is modest enough to love even you? Or
stupid enough? Or--or---"

103. THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS.--"Everything now turns out best for me, I
now love every fate:--who would like to be my fate?"

104. Not their love of humanity, but the impotence of their love,
prevents the Christians of today--burning us.

105. The pia fraus is still more repugnant to the taste (the "piety")
of the free spirit (the "pious man of knowledge") than the impia fraus.
Hence the profound lack of judgment, in comparison with the Church,
characteristic of the type "free spirit"--as ITS non-freedom.

106. By means of music the very passions enjoy themselves.

107. A sign of strong character, when once the resolution has been
taken, to shut the ear even to the best counter-arguments. Occasionally,
therefore, a will to stupidity.

108. There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral
interpretation of phenomena.

109. The criminal is often enough not equal to his deed: he extenuates
and maligns it.

110. The advocates of a criminal are seldom artists enough to turn the
beautiful terribleness of the deed to the advantage of the doer.

111. Our vanity is most difficult to wound just when our pride has been
wounded.

112. To him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and not to
belief, all believers are too noisy and obtrusive; he guards against
them.

113. "You want to prepossess him in your favour? Then you must be
embarrassed before him."

114. The immense expectation with regard to sexual love, and the coyness
in this expectation, spoils all the perspectives of women at the outset.

115. Where there is neither love nor hatred in the game, woman's play is
mediocre.

116. The great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain courage
to rebaptize our badness as the best in us.

117. The will to overcome an emotion, is ultimately only the will of
another, or of several other, emotions.

118. There is an innocence of admiration: it is possessed by him to whom
it has not yet occurred that he himself may be admired some day.

119. Our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our cleaning
ourselves--"justifying" ourselves.

120. Sensuality often forces the growth of love too much, so that its
root remains weak, and is easily torn up.

121. It is a curious thing that God learned Greek when he wished to turn
author--and that he did not learn it better.

122. To rejoice on account of praise is in many cases merely politeness
of heart--and the very opposite of vanity of spirit.

123. Even concubinage has been corrupted--by marriage.

124. He who exults at the stake, does not triumph over pain, but because
of the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected it. A parable.

125. When we have to change an opinion about any one, we charge heavily
to his account the inconvenience he thereby causes us.

126. A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at six or seven great
men.--Yes, and then to get round them.

127. In the eyes of all true women science is hostile to the sense of
shame. They feel as if one wished to peep under their skin with it--or
worse still! under their dress and finery.

128. The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must you
allure the senses to it.

129. The devil has the most extensive perspectives for God; on that
account he keeps so far away from him:--the devil, in effect, as the
oldest friend of knowledge.

130. What a person IS begins to betray itself when his talent
decreases,--when he ceases to show what he CAN do. Talent is also an
adornment; an adornment is also a concealment.

131. The sexes deceive themselves about each other: the reason is that
in reality they honour and love only themselves (or their own ideal, to
express it more agreeably). Thus man wishes woman to be peaceable: but
in fact woman is ESSENTIALLY unpeaceable, like the cat, however well she
may have assumed the peaceable demeanour.

132. One is punished best for one's virtues.

133. He who cannot find the way to HIS ideal, lives more frivolously and
shamelessly than the man without an ideal.

134. From the senses originate all trustworthiness, all good conscience,
all evidence of truth.

135. Pharisaism is not a deterioration of the good man; a considerable
part of it is rather an essential condition of being good.

136. The one seeks an accoucheur for his thoughts, the other seeks some
one whom he can assist: a good conversation thus originates.

137. In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes
of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds
a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very
remarkable man.

138. We do the same when awake as when dreaming: we only invent and
imagine him with whom we have intercourse--and forget it immediately.

139. In revenge and in love woman is more barbarous than man.

140. ADVICE AS A RIDDLE.--"If the band is not to break, bite it
first--secure to make!"

141. The belly is the reason why man does not so readily take himself
for a God.

142. The chastest utterance I ever heard: "Dans le veritable amour c'est
l'ame qui enveloppe le corps."

143. Our vanity would like what we do best to pass precisely for what is
most difficult to us.--Concerning the origin of many systems of morals.

144. When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is generally
something wrong with her sexual nature. Barrenness itself conduces to a
certain virility of taste; man, indeed, if I may say so, is "the barren
animal."

145. Comparing man and woman generally, one may say that woman would
not have the genius for adornment, if she had not the instinct for the
SECONDARY role.

146. He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby
become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will
also gaze into thee.

147. From old Florentine novels--moreover, from life: Buona femmina e
mala femmina vuol bastone.--Sacchetti, Nov. 86.

148. To seduce their neighbour to a favourable opinion, and afterwards
to believe implicitly in this opinion of their neighbour--who can do
this conjuring trick so well as women?

149. That which an age considers evil is usually an unseasonable echo of
what was formerly considered good--the atavism of an old ideal.

150. Around the hero everything becomes a tragedy; around the
demigod everything becomes a satyr-play; and around God everything
becomes--what? perhaps a "world"?

151. It is not enough to possess a talent: one must also have your
permission to possess it;--eh, my friends?

152. "Where there is the tree of knowledge, there is always Paradise":
so say the most ancient and the most modern serpents.

153. What is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil.

154. Objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are signs of
health; everything absolute belongs to pathology.

155. The sense of the tragic increases and declines with sensuousness.

156. Insanity in individuals is something rare--but in groups, parties,
nations, and epochs it is the rule.

157. The thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of it one
gets successfully through many a bad night.

158. Not only our reason, but also our conscience, truckles to our
strongest impulse--the tyrant in us.

159. One MUST repay good and ill; but why just to the person who did us
good or ill?

160. One no longer loves one's knowledge sufficiently after one has
communicated it.

161. Poets act shamelessly towards their experiences: they exploit them.

162. "Our fellow-creature is not our neighbour, but our neighbour's
neighbour":--so thinks every nation.

163. Love brings to light the noble and hidden qualities of a lover--his
rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be deceptive as to his
normal character.

164. Jesus said to his Jews: "The law was for servants;--love God as I
love him, as his Son! What have we Sons of God to do with morals!"

165. IN SIGHT OF EVERY PARTY.--A shepherd has always need of a
bell-wether--or he has himself to be a wether occasionally.

166. One may indeed lie with the mouth; but with the accompanying
grimace one nevertheless tells the truth.

167. To vigorous men intimacy is a matter of shame--and something
precious.

168. Christianity gave Eros poison to drink; he did not die of it,
certainly, but degenerated to Vice.

169. To talk much about oneself may also be a means of concealing
oneself.

170. In praise there is more obtrusiveness than in blame.

171. Pity has an almost ludicrous effect on a man of knowledge, like
tender hands on a Cyclops.

172. One occasionally embraces some one or other, out of love to mankind
(because one cannot embrace all); but this is what one must never
confess to the individual.

173. One does not hate as long as one disesteems, but only when one
esteems equal or superior.

174. Ye Utilitarians--ye, too, love the UTILE only as a VEHICLE for
your inclinations,--ye, too, really find the noise of its wheels
insupportable!

175. One loves ultimately one's desires, not the thing desired.

176. The vanity of others is only counter to our taste when it is
counter to our vanity.

177. With regard to what "truthfulness" is, perhaps nobody has ever been
sufficiently truthful.

178. One does not believe in the follies of clever men: what a
forfeiture of the rights of man!

179. The consequences of our actions seize us by the forelock, very
indifferent to the fact that we have meanwhile "reformed."

180. There is an innocence in lying which is the sign of good faith in a
cause.

181. It is inhuman to bless when one is being cursed.

182. The familiarity of superiors embitters one, because it may not be
returned.

183. "I am affected, not because you have deceived me, but because I can
no longer believe in you."

184. There is a haughtiness of kindness which has the appearance of
wickedness.

185. "I dislike him."--Why?--"I am not a match for him."--Did any one
ever answer so?



CHAPTER V. THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MORALS


186. The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as subtle,
belated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the "Science of Morals"
belonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-fingered:--an
interesting contrast, which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious
in the very person of a moralist. Indeed, the expression, "Science
of Morals" is, in respect to what is designated thereby, far too
presumptuous and counter to GOOD taste,--which is always a foretaste of
more modest expressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT
is still necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for the
present: namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive survey
and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth,
and distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perish--and
perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common
forms of these living crystallizations--as preparation for a THEORY OF
TYPES of morality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest.
All the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness,
demanded of themselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and
ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a science:
they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality--and every philosopher hitherto
has believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself, however, has
been regarded as something "given." How far from their awkward pride
was the seemingly insignificant problem--left in dust and decay--of a
description of forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands
and senses could hardly be fine enough for it! It was precisely owing to
moral philosophers' knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an arbitrary
epitome, or an accidental abridgement--perhaps as the morality of
their environment, their position, their church, their Zeitgeist, their
climate and zone--it was precisely because they were badly instructed
with regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by no means eager
to know about these matters, that they did not even come in sight of the
real problems of morals--problems which only disclose themselves by
a comparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every "Science of Morals"
hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself
has been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything
problematic there! That which philosophers called "giving a basis to
morality," and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right light,
proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality, a new
means of its EXPRESSION, consequently just a matter-of-fact within the
sphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of
denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in question--and
in any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and
vivisecting of this very faith. Hear, for instance, with what
innocence--almost worthy of honour--Schopenhauer represents his own
task, and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a
"Science" whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and
old wives: "The principle," he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme der
Ethik), [Footnote: Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauer's Basis of Morality,
translated by Arthur B. Bullock, M.A. (1903).] "the axiom about the
purport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laede,
immo omnes quantum potes juva--is REALLY the proposition which all moral
teachers strive to establish, ... the REAL basis of ethics which
has been sought, like the philosopher's stone, for centuries."--The
difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be
great--it is well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his
efforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and
sentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is Will
to Power, may be reminded that Schopenhauer, although a pessimist,
ACTUALLY--played the flute... daily after dinner: one may read about
the matter in his biography. A question by the way: a pessimist, a
repudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES A HALT at morality--who
assents to morality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what?
Is that really--a pessimist?

187. Apart from the value of such assertions as "there is a categorical
imperative in us," one can always ask: What does such an assertion
indicate about him who makes it? There are systems of morals which are
meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systems
of morals are meant to tranquilize him, and make him self-satisfied;
with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself, with others
he wishes to take revenge, with others to conceal himself, with others
to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction,--this system of
morals helps its author to forget, that system makes him, or something
of him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and
creative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant
especially, gives us to understand by his morals that "what is estimable
in me, is that I know how to obey--and with you it SHALL not be
otherwise than with me!" In short, systems of morals are only a
SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.

188. In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of
tyranny against "nature" and also against "reason", that is, however, no
objection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that
all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is
essential and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a
long constraint. In order to understand Stoicism, or Port Royal,
or Puritanism, one should remember the constraint under which every
language has attained to strength and freedom--the metrical constraint,
the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. How much trouble have the poets and
orators of every nation given themselves!--not excepting some of
the prose writers of today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable
conscientiousness--"for the sake of a folly," as utilitarian bunglers
say, and thereby deem themselves wise--"from submission to arbitrary
laws," as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves "free," even
free-spirited. The singular fact remains, however, that everything
of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and masterly
certainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought itself,
or in administration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just as in
conduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary
law, and in all seriousness, it is not at all improbable that precisely
this is "nature" and "natural"--and not laisser-aller! Every artist
knows how different from the state of letting himself go, is his
"most natural" condition, the free arranging, locating, disposing,
and constructing in the moments of "inspiration"--and how strictly and
delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very rigidness
and precision, defy all formulation by means of ideas (even the most
stable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold,
and ambiguous in it). The essential thing "in heaven and in earth" is,
apparently (to repeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE
in the same direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in
the long run, something which has made life worth living; for instance,
virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality--anything whatever
that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine. The long bondage of
the spirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of
ideas, the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think
in accordance with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable
to Aristotelian premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret
everything that happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every
occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God:--all this
violence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness,
has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has
attained its strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility;
granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be
stifled, suffocated, and spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere,
"nature" shows herself as she is, in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT
magnificence, which is shocking, but nevertheless noble). That
for centuries European thinkers only thought in order to prove
something--nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every thinker
who "wishes to prove something"--that it was always settled beforehand
what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking, as it was perhaps
in the Asiatic astrology of former times, or as it is still at the
present day in the innocent, Christian-moral explanation of immediate
personal events "for the glory of God," or "for the good of the
soul":--this tyranny, this arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent
stupidity, has EDUCATED the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and
the finer sense, is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual
education and discipline. One may look at every system of morals in this
light: it is "nature" therein which teaches to hate the laisser-aller,
the too great freedom, and implants the need for limited horizons, for
immediate duties--it teaches the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in
a certain sense, that stupidity is a condition of life and development.
"Thou must obey some one, and for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come
to grief, and lose all respect for thyself"--this seems to me to be the
moral imperative of nature, which is certainly neither "categorical,"
as old Kant wished (consequently the "otherwise"), nor does it address
itself to the individual (what does nature care for the individual!),
but to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all, however, to the
animal "man" generally, to MANKIND.

189. Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was a
master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such
an extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his week--and
work-day again:--as a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly intercalated
FAST, such as is also frequently found in the ancient world (although,
as is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely with respect
to work). Many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful
influences and habits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary
days are appointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to
hunger anew. Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations and
epochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism,
seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting, during
which an impulse learns to humble and submit itself--at the same time
also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewise
admit of a similar interpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst
of Hellenic culture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with
Aphrodisiacal odours).--Here also is a hint for the explanation of the
paradox, why it was precisely in the most Christian period of European
history, and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentiments,
that the sexual impulse sublimated into love (amour-passion).

190. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not really
belong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might
say, in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he himself was
too noble. "No one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done
unwittingly. The evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do
so, however, if he knew that evil is evil. The evil man, therefore, is
only evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarily
make him--good."--This mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who
perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically
judge that "it is STUPID to do wrong"; while they accept "good" as
identical with "useful and pleasant," without further thought. As
regards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it
has the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.--Plato
did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the
tenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret himself into them--he,
the most daring of all interpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out
of the street, as a popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless
and impossible modifications--namely, in all his own disguises and
multiplicities. In jest, and in Homeric language as well, what is the
Platonic Socrates, if not--[Greek words inserted here.]

191. The old theological problem of "Faith" and "Knowledge," or more
plainly, of instinct and reason--the question whether, in respect to the
valuation of things, instinct deserves more authority than rationality,
which wants to appreciate and act according to motives, according to
a "Why," that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utility--it
is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of
Socrates, and had divided men's minds long before Christianity. Socrates
himself, following, of course, the taste of his talent--that of a
surpassing dialectician--took first the side of reason; and, in fact,
what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the
noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could
never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions?
In the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also
at himself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found
in himself the same difficulty and incapacity. "But why"--he said
to himself--"should one on that account separate oneself from the
instincts! One must set them right, and the reason ALSO--one must follow
the instincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support them
with good arguments." This was the real FALSENESS of that great and
mysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the point that he
was satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact, he perceived
the irrationality in the moral judgment.--Plato, more innocent in such
matters, and without the craftiness of the plebeian, wished to prove to
himself, at the expenditure of all his strength--the greatest strength
a philosopher had ever expended--that reason and instinct lead
spontaneously to one goal, to the good, to "God"; and since Plato, all
theologians and philosophers have followed the same path--which means
that in matters of morality, instinct (or as Christians call it,
"Faith," or as I call it, "the herd") has hitherto triumphed. Unless
one should make an exception in the case of Descartes, the father of
rationalism (and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution), who
recognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a tool, and
Descartes was superficial.

192. Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in
its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest
processes of all "knowledge and cognizance": there, as here, the
premature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to "belief,"
and the lack of distrust and patience are first developed--our senses
learn late, and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and
cautious organs of knowledge. Our eyes find it easier on a given
occasion to produce a picture already often produced, than to seize upon
the divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires more
force, more "morality." It is difficult and painful for the ear to
listen to anything new; we hear strange music badly. When we hear
another language spoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds
into words with which we are more familiar and conversant--it was thus,
for example, that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into
ARMBRUST (cross-bow). Our senses are also hostile and averse to the
new; and generally, even in the "simplest" processes of sensation, the
emotions DOMINATE--such as fear, love, hatred, and the passive emotion
of indolence.--As little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words
(not to speak of syllables) of a page--he rather takes about five out
of every twenty words at random, and "guesses" the probably appropriate
sense to them--just as little do we see a tree correctly and completely
in respect to its leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so
much easier to fancy the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of the
most remarkable experiences, we still do just the same; we fabricate the
greater part of the experience, and can hardly be made to contemplate
any event, EXCEPT as "inventors" thereof. All this goes to prove
that from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have
been--ACCUSTOMED TO LYING. Or, to express it more politely and
hypocritically, in short, more pleasantly--one is much more of an artist
than one is aware of.--In an animated conversation, I often see the face
of the person with whom I am speaking so clearly and sharply defined
before me, according to the thought he expresses, or which I believe to
be evoked in his mind, that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the
STRENGTH of my visual faculty--the delicacy of the play of the muscles
and of the expression of the eyes MUST therefore be imagined by me.
Probably the person put on quite a different expression, or none at all.

193. Quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise. What we
experience in dreams, provided we experience it often, pertains at
last just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything
"actually" experienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer, we
have a requirement more or less, and finally, in broad daylight, and
even in the brightest moments of our waking life, we are ruled to some
extent by the nature of our dreams. Supposing that someone has often
flown in his dreams, and that at last, as soon as he dreams, he is
conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his
peculiarly enviable happiness; such a person, who believes that on the
slightest impulse, he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who
knows the sensation of a certain divine levity, an "upwards"
without effort or constraint, a "downwards" without descending
or lowering--without TROUBLE!--how could the man with such
dream-experiences and dream-habits fail to find "happiness" differently
coloured and defined, even in his waking hours! How could he fail--to
long DIFFERENTLY for happiness? "Flight," such as is described by poets,
must, when compared with his own "flying," be far too earthly, muscular,
violent, far too "troublesome" for him.

194. The difference among men does not manifest itself only in the
difference of their lists of desirable things--in their regarding
different good things as worth striving for, and being disagreed as to
the greater or less value, the order of rank, of the commonly recognized
desirable things:--it manifests itself much more in what they regard as
actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing. As regards a woman,
for instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification
serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the
more modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for
possession, sees the "questionableness," the mere apparentness of such
ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially
whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for
his sake what she has or would like to have--only THEN does he look upon
her as "possessed." A third, however, has not even here got to the limit
of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether
the woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do
so for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed,
profoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let
himself be found out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in
his possession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when
she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed
insatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and spirituality. One
man would like to possess a nation, and he finds all the higher arts of
Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose. Another, with a more
refined thirst for possession, says to himself: "One may not deceive
where one desires to possess"--he is irritated and impatient at the idea
that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: "I must,
therefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know myself!"
Among helpful and charitable people, one almost always finds the awkward
craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as
though, for instance, he should "merit" help, seek just THEIR help, and
would show himself deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them
for all help. With these conceits, they take control of the needy as a
property, just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a
desire for property. One finds them jealous when they are crossed or
forestalled in their charity. Parents involuntarily make something like
themselves out of their children--they call that "education"; no mother
doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is
thereby her property, no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN
ideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in former times fathers deemed it
right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly
born (as among the ancient Germans). And like the father, so also do the
teacher, the class, the priest, and the prince still see in every new
individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession. The
consequence is...

195. The Jews--a people "born for slavery," as Tacitus and the whole
ancient world say of them; "the chosen people among the nations," as
they themselves say and believe--the Jews performed the miracle of the
inversion of valuations, by means of which life on earth obtained a new
and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums. Their prophets fused
into one the expressions "rich," "godless," "wicked," "violent,"
"sensual," and for the first time coined the word "world" as a term of
reproach. In this inversion of valuations (in which is also included
the use of the word "poor" as synonymous with "saint" and "friend") the
significance of the Jewish people is to be found; it is with THEM that
the SLAVE-INSURRECTION IN MORALS commences.

196. It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark bodies near the
sun--such as we shall never see. Among ourselves, this is an allegory;
and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star-writing merely as an
allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed.

197. The beast of prey and the man of prey (for instance, Caesar Borgia)
are fundamentally misunderstood, "nature" is misunderstood, so long as
one seeks a "morbidness" in the constitution of these healthiest of
all tropical monsters and growths, or even an innate "hell" in them--as
almost all moralists have done hitherto. Does it not seem that there is
a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists? And
that the "tropical man" must be discredited at all costs, whether
as disease and deterioration of mankind, or as his own hell and
self-torture? And why? In favour of the "temperate zones"? In favour
of the temperate men? The "moral"? The mediocre?--This for the chapter:
"Morals as Timidity."

198. All the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to
their "happiness," as it is called--what else are they but suggestions
for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves in which
the individuals live; recipes for their passions, their good and bad
propensities, insofar as such have the Will to Power and would like
to play the master; small and great expediencies and elaborations,
permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old-wife
wisdom; all of them grotesque and absurd in their form--because
they address themselves to "all," because they generalize where
generalization is not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionally,
and taking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not merely
with one grain of salt, but rather endurable only, and sometimes even
seductive, when they are over-spiced and begin to smell dangerously,
especially of "the other world." That is all of little value when
estimated intellectually, and is far from being "science," much less
"wisdom"; but, repeated once more, and three times repeated, it is
expediency, expediency, expediency, mixed with stupidity, stupidity,
stupidity--whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness
towards the heated folly of the emotions, which the Stoics advised and
fostered; or the no-more-laughing and no-more-weeping of Spinoza, the
destruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection, which he
recommended so naively; or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent
mean at which they may be satisfied, the Aristotelianism of morals;
or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary
attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art, perhaps as
music, or as love of God, and of mankind for God's sake--for in religion
the passions are once more enfranchised, provided that...; or, finally,
even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions, as has
been taught by Hafis and Goethe, the bold letting-go of the reins, the
spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of
wise old codgers and drunkards, with whom it "no longer has much
danger."--This also for the chapter: "Morals as Timidity."

199. Inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed, there have
also been human herds (family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples,
states, churches), and always a great number who obey in proportion
to the small number who command--in view, therefore, of the fact that
obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto,
one may reasonably suppose that, generally speaking, the need thereof is
now innate in every one, as a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which gives
the command "Thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally
refrain from something", in short, "Thou shalt". This need tries to
satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content, according to its
strength, impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous
appetite with little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into
its ear by all sorts of commanders--parents, teachers, laws, class
prejudices, or public opinion. The extraordinary limitation of human
development, the hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and
turning thereof, is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of
obedience is transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. If
one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders
and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they
will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and will have to impose
a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to
command just as if they also were only obeying. This condition of things
actually exists in Europe at present--I call it the moral hypocrisy of
the commanding class. They know no other way of protecting themselves
from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older
and higher orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice, of
the law, or of God himself), or they even justify themselves by maxims
from the current opinions of the herd, as "first servants of their
people," or "instruments of the public weal". On the other hand, the
gregarious European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only
kind of man that is allowable, he glorifies his qualities, such as
public spirit, kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty,
indulgence, sympathy, by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and
useful to the herd, as the peculiarly human virtues. In cases, however,
where it is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed
with, attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders
by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative
constitutions, for example, are of this origin. In spite of all, what a
blessing, what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable, is the
appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeans--of this
fact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon was the last great proof
the history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history of
the higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in its
worthiest individuals and periods.

200. The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with
one another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his
body--that is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary, instincts
and standards of value, which struggle with one another and are seldom
at peace--such a man of late culture and broken lights, will, on an
average, be a weak man. His fundamental desire is that the war which is
IN HIM should come to an end; happiness appears to him in the character
of a soothing medicine and mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean
or Christian); it is above all things the happiness of repose, of
undisturbedness, of repletion, of final unity--it is the "Sabbath of
Sabbaths," to use the expression of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine,
who was himself such a man.--Should, however, the contrariety and
conflict in such natures operate as an ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus
to life--and if, on the other hand, in addition to their powerful and
irreconcilable instincts, they have also inherited and indoctrinated
into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict
with themselves (that is to say, the faculty of self-control and
self-deception), there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and
inexplicable beings, those enigmatical men, predestined for conquering
and circumventing others, the finest examples of which are Alcibiades
and Caesar (with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeans
according to my taste, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick the Second), and
among artists, perhaps Leonardo da Vinci. They appear precisely in the
same periods when that weaker type, with its longing for repose, comes
to the front; the two types are complementary to each other, and spring
from the same causes.

201. As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only
gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only
kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in
what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be
no "morality of love to one's neighbour." Granted even that there is
already a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness,
gentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition
of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly
distinguished by honourable names as "virtues," and eventually almost
coincide with the conception "morality": in that period they do not
as yet belong to the domain of moral valuations--they are still
ULTRA-MORAL. A sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good
nor bad, moral nor immoral, in the best period of the Romans; and should
it be praised, a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this
praise, even at the best, directly the sympathetic action is compared
with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES
PUBLICA. After all, "love to our neighbour" is always a secondary
matter, partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to
our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After the fabric of society seems on the
whole established and secured against external dangers, it is this
fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral
valuation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts, such as the love of
enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and
love of power, which up till then had not only to be honoured from the
point of view of general utility--under other names, of course, than
those here given--but had to be fostered and cultivated (because they
were perpetually required in the common danger against the common
enemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong--when
the outlets for them are lacking--and are gradually branded as immoral
and given over to calumny. The contrary instincts and inclinations now
attain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct gradually draws its
conclusions. How much or how little dangerousness to the community or
to equality is contained in an opinion, a condition, an emotion, a
disposition, or an endowment--that is now the moral perspective, here
again fear is the mother of morals. It is by the loftiest and strongest
instincts, when they break out passionately and carry the individual
far above and beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious
conscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its
belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these
very instincts will be most branded and defamed. The lofty independent
spirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the cogent reason, are
felt to be dangers, everything that elevates the individual above the
herd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called
EVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing
disposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral distinction and
honour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is always
less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity
and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice, begins
to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and
self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, "the lamb,"
and still more "the sheep," wins respect. There is a point of diseased
mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society
itself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL,
and does so, in fact, seriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it
to be somehow unfair--it is certain that the idea of "punishment" and
"the obligation to punish" are then painful and alarming to people. "Is
it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why should we
still punish? Punishment itself is terrible!"--with these questions
gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate
conclusion. If one could at all do away with danger, the cause of fear,
one would have done away with this morality at the same time, it
would no longer be necessary, it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer
necessary!--Whoever examines the conscience of the present-day European,
will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds
and hidden recesses, the imperative of the timidity of the herd "we wish
that some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR!" Some time
or other--the will and the way THERETO is nowadays called "progress" all
over Europe.

202. Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred
times, for people's ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths--OUR
truths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one
plainly, and without metaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will
be accounted to us almost a CRIME, that it is precisely in respect to
men of "modern ideas" that we have constantly applied the terms "herd,"
"herd-instincts," and such like expressions. What avail is it? We cannot
do otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is. We
have found that in all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become
unanimous, including likewise the countries where European influence
prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he
did not know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to
teach--they "know" today what is good and evil. It must then sound hard
and be distasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which
here thinks it knows, that which here glorifies itself with praise
and blame, and calls itself good, is the instinct of the herding human
animal, the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more
to the front, to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts,
according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance
of which it is the symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS
HERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and therefore, as we understand the matter,
only one kind of human morality, beside which, before which, and after
which many other moralities, and above all HIGHER moralities, are or
should be possible. Against such a "possibility," against such a "should
be," however, this morality defends itself with all its strength, it
says obstinately and inexorably "I am morality itself and nothing else
is morality!" Indeed, with the help of a religion which has humoured
and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal, things have
reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of
this morality even in political and social arrangements: the DEMOCRATIC
movement is the inheritance of the Christian movement. That its TEMPO,
however, is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones, for
those who are sick and distracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated
by the increasingly furious howling, and always less disguised
teeth-gnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now roving through the
highways of European culture. Apparently in opposition to the peacefully
industrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and still more so
to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries who call
themselves Socialists and want a "free society," those are really at one
with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form
of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the extent even of
repudiating the notions "master" and "servant"--ni dieu ni maitre, says
a socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every
special claim, every special right and privilege (this means ultimately
opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no one needs "rights"
any longer); at one in their distrust of punitive justice (as though it
were a violation of the weak, unfair to the NECESSARY consequences of
all former society); but equally at one in their religion of sympathy,
in their compassion for all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the
very animals, up even to "God"--the extravagance of "sympathy for
God" belongs to a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and
impatience of their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering
generally, in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or
ALLOWING it; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening,
under the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new
Buddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy, as
though it were morality in itself, the climax, the ATTAINED climax of
mankind, the sole hope of the future, the consolation of the present,
the great discharge from all the obligations of the past; altogether at
one in their belief in the community as the DELIVERER, in the herd, and
therefore in "themselves."

203. We, who hold a different belief--we, who regard the democratic
movement, not only as a degenerating form of political organization, but
as equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type of man, as involving his
mediocrising and depreciation: where have WE to fix our hopes? In
NEW PHILOSOPHERS--there is no other alternative: in minds strong and
original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvalue
and invert "eternal valuations"; in forerunners, in men of the future,
who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which
will compel millenniums to take NEW paths. To teach man the future
of humanity as his WILL, as depending on human will, and to make
preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in
rearing and educating, in order thereby to put an end to the frightful
rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of
"history" (the folly of the "greatest number" is only its last
form)--for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will
some time or other be needed, at the very idea of which everything that
has existed in the way of occult, terrible, and benevolent beings might
look pale and dwarfed. The image of such leaders hovers before OUR
eyes:--is it lawful for me to say it aloud, ye free spirits? The
conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for
their genesis; the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which
a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a
CONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values, under the new
pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart
transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of such responsibility;
and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders, the dreadful
danger that they might be lacking, or miscarry and degenerate:--these
are OUR real anxieties and glooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits!
these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the
heaven of OUR life. There are few pains so grievous as to have seen,
divined, or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and
deteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger
of "man" himself DETERIORATING, he who like us has recognized the
extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in
respect to the future of mankind--a game in which neither the hand, nor
even a "finger of God" has participated!--he who divines the fate that
is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of
"modern ideas," and still more under the whole of Christo-European
morality--suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared.
He sees at a glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through
a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and
arrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how
unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities, and how often
in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions
and new paths:--he knows still better from his painfulest recollections
on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank
have hitherto usually gone to pieces, broken down, sunk, and become
contemptible. The UNIVERSAL DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of
the "man of the future"--as idealized by the socialistic fools and
shallow-pates--this degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely
gregarious animal (or as they call it, to a man of "free society"),
this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims, is
undoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out this possibility to its
ultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown to the rest of
mankind--and perhaps also a new MISSION!



CHAPTER VI. WE SCHOLARS


204. At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that
which it has always been--namely, resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES,
according to Balzac--I would venture to protest against an improper and
injurious alteration of rank, which quite unnoticed, and as if with the
best conscience, threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations
of science and philosophy. I mean to say that one must have the right
out of one's own EXPERIENCE--experience, as it seems to me, always
implies unfortunate experience?--to treat of such an important question
of rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST science
like women and artists ("Ah! this dreadful science!" sigh their instinct
and their shame, "it always FINDS THINGS OUT!"). The declaration of
independence of the scientific man, his emancipation from philosophy,
is one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization and
disorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness of
the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best
springtime--which does not mean to imply that in this case self-praise
smells sweet. Here also the instinct of the populace cries, "Freedom
from all masters!" and after science has, with the happiest results,
resisted theology, whose "hand-maid" it had been too long, it now
proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for
philosophy, and in its turn to play the "master"--what am I saying!
to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own account. My memory--the memory of
a scientific man, if you please!--teems with the naivetes of insolence
which I have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young
naturalists and old physicians (not to mention the most cultured and
most conceited of all learned men, the philologists and schoolmasters,
who are both the one and the other by profession). On one occasion it
was the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the
defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another time
it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined
luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and felt
himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion it was the
colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but
a series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant expenditure which "does
nobody any good". At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of
the boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another
time the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily
extended to disregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most
frequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars,
the evil after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the
whole obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his
scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of--the
result being a general ill-will to all philosophy. (Such seems to
me, for instance, the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern
Germany: by his unintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in
severing the whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection
with German culture, which culture, all things considered, has been
an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE, but
precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive,
and un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.) On the whole, speaking
generally, it may just have been the humanness, all-too-humanness of the
modern philosophers themselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which
has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the
doors to the instinct of the populace. Let it but be acknowledged to
what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the
world of Heraclitus, Plato, Empedocles, and whatever else all the royal
and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called, and with what
justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family and
origin, in view of such representatives of philosophy, who, owing to
the fashion of the present day, are just as much aloft as they are down
below--in Germany, for instance, the two lions of Berlin, the anarchist
Eugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It is especially
the sight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves
"realists," or "positivists," which is calculated to implant a
dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those
philosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and specialists,
that is very evident! All of them are persons who have been vanquished
and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of science, who at one time
or another claimed more from themselves, without having a right to the
"more" and its responsibility--and who now, creditably, rancorously, and
vindictively, represent in word and deed, DISBELIEF in the master-task
and supremacy of philosophy After all, how could it be otherwise?
Science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible
on its countenance, while that to which the entire modern philosophy has
gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the present day, excites
distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to
a "theory of knowledge," no more in fact than a diffident science of
epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even
gets beyond the threshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the right
to enter--that is philosophy in its last throes, an end, an agony,
something that awakens pity. How could such a philosophy--RULE!

205. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in
fact, so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit
could still come to maturity. The extent and towering structure of the
sciences have increased enormously, and therewith also the probability
that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach
himself somewhere and "specialize" so that he will no longer attain to
his elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection,
and his DESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his
maturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and
deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no
longer of much importance. It is perhaps just the refinement of his
intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the
way, he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a
milleantenna, he knows too well that as a discerner, one who has lost
his self-respect no longer commands, no longer LEADS, unless he should
aspire to become a great play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and
spiritual rat-catcher--in short, a misleader. This is in the last
instance a question of taste, if it has not really been a question of
conscience. To double once more the philosopher's difficulties, there is
also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a Yea or Nay, not
concerning science, but concerning life and the worth of life--he learns
unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain
this verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief
only through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying)
experiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded. In fact, the
philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude, either
with the scientific man and ideal scholar, or with the religiously
elevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and God-intoxicated
man; and even yet when one hears anybody praised, because he lives
"wisely," or "as a philosopher," it hardly means anything more than
"prudently and apart." Wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kind
of flight, a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a
bad game; but the GENUINE philosopher--does it not seem so to US,
my friends?--lives "unphilosophically" and "unwisely," above all,
IMPRUDENTLY, and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts
and temptations of life--he risks HIMSELF constantly, he plays THIS bad
game.

206. In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who either
ENGENDERS or PRODUCES--both words understood in their fullest sense--the
man of learning, the scientific average man, has always something of
the old maid about him; for, like her, he is not conversant with the two
principal functions of man. To both, of course, to the scholar and
to the old maid, one concedes respectability, as if by way of
indemnification--in these cases one emphasizes the respectability--and
yet, in the compulsion of this concession, one has the same admixture
of vexation. Let us examine more closely: what is the scientific man?
Firstly, a commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is
to say, a non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient type
of man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file,
equability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the
instinct for people like himself, and for that which they require--for
instance: the portion of independence and green meadow without which
there is no rest from labour, the claim to honour and consideration
(which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability),
the sunshine of a good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and
usefulness, with which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of
the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and
again to be overcome. The learned man, as is appropriate, has also
maladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and
has a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations
he cannot attain. He is confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go,
but does not FLOW; and precisely before the man of the great current he
stands all the colder and more reserved--his eye is then like a smooth
and irresponsive lake, which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy.
The worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results
from the instinct of mediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of
mediocrity, which labours instinctively for the destruction of
the exceptional man, and endeavours to break--or still better, to
relax--every bent bow To relax, of course, with consideration, and
naturally with an indulgent hand--to RELAX with confiding sympathy
that is the real art of Jesuitism, which has always understood how to
introduce itself as the religion of sympathy.

207. However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spirit--and
who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded
IPSISIMOSITY!--in the end, however, one must learn caution even with
regard to one's gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with
which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been
celebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were salvation
and glorification--as is especially accustomed to happen in the
pessimist school, which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the
highest honours to "disinterested knowledge" The objective man, who no
longer curses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning
in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand
complete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the most costly
instruments that exist, but his place is in the hand of one who is more
powerful He is only an instrument, we may say, he is a MIRROR--he is no
"purpose in himself" The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed
to prostration before everything that wants to be known, with such
desires only as knowing or "reflecting" implies--he waits until
something comes, and then expands himself sensitively, so that even the
light footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on
his surface and film Whatever "personality" he still possesses seems to
him accidental, arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has he
come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms
and events He calls up the recollection of "himself" with an effort,
and not infrequently wrongly, he readily confounds himself with other
persons, he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs, and here only
is he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health,
or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack
of companions and society--indeed, he sets himself to reflect on his
suffering, but in vain! His thoughts already rove away to the MORE
GENERAL case, and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how
to help himself He does not now take himself seriously and devote time
to himself he is serene, NOT from lack of trouble, but from lack
of capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual
complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences, the radiant
and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that
comes his way, his habit of inconsiderate good-nature, of dangerous
indifference as to Yea and Nay: alas! there are enough of cases in which
he has to atone for these virtues of his!--and as man generally, he
becomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtues. Should one
wish love or hatred from him--I mean love and hatred as God, woman, and
animal understand them--he will do what he can, and furnish what he can.
But one must not be surprised if it should not be much--if he should
show himself just at this point to be false, fragile, questionable, and
deteriorated. His love is constrained, his hatred is artificial, and
rather UN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight ostentation and exaggeration. He is
only genuine so far as he can be objective; only in his serene totality
is he still "nature" and "natural." His mirroring and eternally
self-polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm, no longer how to
deny; he does not command; neither does he destroy. "JE NE MEPRISE
PRESQUE RIEN"--he says, with Leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue
the PRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of any
one, nor after, either; he places himself generally too far off to have
any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil. If he has
been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER, with the Caesarian trainer
and dictator of civilization, he has had far too much honour, and what
is more essential in him has been overlooked--he is an instrument,
something of a slave, though certainly the sublimest sort of slave, but
nothing in himself--PRESQUE RIEN! The objective man is an instrument,
a costly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring instrument and
mirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and respected; but he
is no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary man in whom the
REST of existence justifies itself, no termination--and still less a
commencement, an engendering, or primary cause, nothing hardy, powerful,
self-centred, that wants to be master; but rather only a soft, inflated,
delicate, movable potter's-form, that must wait for some kind of content
and frame to "shape" itself thereto--for the most part a man without
frame and content, a "selfless" man. Consequently, also, nothing for
women, IN PARENTHESI.

208. When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic--I
hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the
objective spirit?--people all hear it impatiently; they regard him on
that account with some apprehension, they would like to ask so many,
many questions... indeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so
many, he is henceforth said to be dangerous. With his repudiation of
skepticism, it seems to them as if they heard some evil-threatening
sound in the distance, as if a new kind of explosive were being tried
somewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered Russian
NIHILINE, a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS, that not only denies, means
denial, but--dreadful thought! PRACTISES denial. Against this kind of
"good-will"--a will to the veritable, actual negation of life--there is,
as is generally acknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative
than skepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism;
and Hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an
antidote to the "spirit," and its underground noises. "Are not our ears
already full of bad sounds?" say the skeptics, as lovers of repose, and
almost as a kind of safety police; "this subterranean Nay is terrible!
Be still, ye pessimistic moles!" The skeptic, in effect, that delicate
creature, is far too easily frightened; his conscience is schooled so
as to start at every Nay, and even at that sharp, decided Yea, and feels
something like a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay!--they seem to him opposed
to morality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a festival to his virtue
by a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with Montaigne: "What do I
know?" Or with Socrates: "I know that I know nothing." Or: "Here I do
not trust myself, no door is open to me." Or: "Even if the door were
open, why should I enter immediately?" Or: "What is the use of any hasty
hypotheses? It might quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses
at all. Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is
crooked? to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum? Is there not time
enough for that? Has not the time leisure? Oh, ye demons, can ye not
at all WAIT? The uncertain also has its charms, the Sphinx, too, is a
Circe, and Circe, too, was a philosopher."--Thus does a skeptic console
himself; and in truth he needs some consolation. For skepticism is
the most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiological
temperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and
sickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have been long
separated, decisively and suddenly blend with one another. In the new
generation, which has inherited as it were different standards and
valuations in its blood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and
tentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very virtues
prevent each other growing and becoming strong, equilibrium, ballast,
and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul. That, however,
which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the
WILL; they are no longer familiar with independence of decision, or
the courageous feeling of pleasure in willing--they are doubtful of the
"freedom of the will" even in their dreams Our present-day Europe,
the scene of a senseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of
classes, and CONSEQUENTLY of races, is therefore skeptical in all its
heights and depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which
springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch, sometimes with
gloomy aspect, like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signs--and
often sick unto death of its will! Paralysis of will, where do we not
find this cripple sitting nowadays! And yet how bedecked oftentimes' How
seductively ornamented! There are the finest gala dresses and disguises
for this disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself
nowadays in the show-cases as "objectiveness," "the scientific spirit,"
"L'ART POUR L'ART," and "pure voluntary knowledge," is only decked-out
skepticism and paralysis of will--I am ready to answer for this
diagnosis of the European disease--The disease of the will is diffused
unequally over Europe, it is worst and most varied where civilization
has longest prevailed, it decreases according as "the barbarian"
still--or again--asserts his claims under the loose drapery of Western
culture It is therefore in the France of today, as can be readily
disclosed and comprehended, that the will is most infirm, and France,
which has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the
portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive,
now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over Europe,
by being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism The
power to will and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is already
somewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the North of Germany it
is stronger than in Central Germany, it is considerably stronger in
England, Spain, and Corsica, associated with phlegm in the former and
with hard skulls in the latter--not to mention Italy, which is too young
yet to know what it wants, and must first show whether it can exercise
will, but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense
middle empire where Europe as it were flows back to Asia--namely, in
Russia There the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated,
there the will--uncertain whether to be negative or affirmative--waits
threateningly to be discharged (to borrow their pet phrase from our
physicists) Perhaps not only Indian wars and complications in Asia would
be necessary to free Europe from its greatest danger, but also internal
subversion, the shattering of the empire into small states, and above
all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility, together with the
obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do not
say this as one who desires it, in my heart I should rather prefer the
contrary--I mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of
Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally
threatening--namely, TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL, by means of a new caste to
rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that
can set its aims thousands of years ahead; so that the long spun-out
comedy of its petty-statism, and its dynastic as well as its democratic
many-willed-ness, might finally be brought to a close. The time for
petty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the
dominion of the world--the COMPULSION to great politics.

209. As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have
evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger
kind of skepticism, I should like to express myself preliminarily
merely by a parable, which the lovers of German history will already
understand. That unscrupulous enthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers
(who, as King of Prussia, brought into being a military and skeptical
genius--and therewith, in reality, the new and now triumphantly emerged
type of German), the problematic, crazy father of Frederick the Great,
had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew
what was then lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred times
more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form--his
ill-will to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound
instinct. MEN WERE LACKING; and he suspected, to his bitterest regret,
that his own son was not man enough. There, however, he deceived
himself; but who would not have deceived himself in his place? He saw
his son lapsed to atheism, to the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of
clever Frenchmen--he saw in the background the great bloodsucker, the
spider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no
longer hard enough either for evil or good, and of a broken will that no
longer commands, is no longer ABLE to command. Meanwhile, however,
there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous
skepticism--who knows TO WHAT EXTENT it was encouraged just by
his father's hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to
solitude?--the skepticism of daring manliness, which is closely related
to the genius for war and conquest, and made its first entrance into
Germany in the person of the great Frederick. This skepticism despises
and nevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it does
not believe, but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the spirit a
dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard over the heart. It is the
GERMAN form of skepticism, which, as a continued Fredericianism, risen
to the highest spirituality, has kept Europe for a considerable time
under the dominion of the German spirit and its critical and historical
distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character
of the great German philologists and historical critics (who,
rightly estimated, were also all of them artists of destruction
and dissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually
established itself--in spite of all Romanticism in music and
philosophy--in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was
decidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of gaze, as
courage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as resolute will to
dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized North Pole expeditions
under barren and dangerous skies. There may be good grounds for it when
warm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this
spirit, CET ESPRIT FATALISTE, IRONIQUE, MEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet
calls it, not without a shudder. But if one would realize how
characteristic is this fear of the "man" in the German spirit which
awakened Europe out of its "dogmatic slumber," let us call to mind the
former conception which had to be overcome by this new one--and that
it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with
unbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the interest of
Europe as gentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools.
Finally, let us only understand profoundly enough Napoleon's
astonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for
centuries as the "German spirit" "VOILA UN HOMME!"--that was as much as
to say "But this is a MAN! And I only expected to see a German!"

210. Supposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the
future, some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps
be skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in them would only be
designated thereby--and not they themselves. With equal right they might
call themselves critics, and assuredly they will be men of experiments.
By the name with which I ventured to baptize them, I have already
expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is
this because, as critics in body and soul, they will love to make use
of experiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense? In
their passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in daring and
painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic
century can approve of?--There is no doubt these coming ones will be
least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities
which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty as to
standards of worth, the conscious employment of a unity of method,
the wary courage, the standing-alone, and the capacity for
self-responsibility, indeed, they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT
in denial and dissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows
how to handle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds
They will be STERNER (and perhaps not always towards themselves only)
than humane people may desire, they will not deal with the "truth" in
order that it may "please" them, or "elevate" and "inspire" them--they
will rather have little faith in "TRUTH" bringing with it such revels
for the feelings. They will smile, those rigorous spirits, when any one
says in their presence "That thought elevates me, why should it not be
true?" or "That work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?" or
"That artist enlarges me, why should he not be great?" Perhaps they
will not only have a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus
rapturous, idealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if any one
could look into their inmost hearts, he would not easily find therein
the intention to reconcile "Christian sentiments" with "antique taste,"
or even with "modern parliamentarism" (the kind of reconciliation
necessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain and
consequently very conciliatory century). Critical discipline, and every
habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters,
will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of
the future, they may even make a display thereof as their special
adornment--nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that
account. It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to
have it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that "philosophy itself is
criticism and critical science--and nothing else whatever!" Though this
estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists of
France and Germany (and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste
of KANT: let us call to mind the titles of his principal works), our new
philosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are instruments of
the philosopher, and just on that account, as instruments, they are
far from being philosophers themselves! Even the great Chinaman of
Konigsberg was only a great critic.

211. I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding
philosophical workers, and in general scientific men, with
philosophers--that precisely here one should strictly give "each his
own," and not give those far too much, these far too little. It may
be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself
should have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants,
the scientific workers of philosophy, remain standing, and MUST remain
standing he himself must perhaps have been critic, and dogmatist,
and historian, and besides, poet, and collector, and traveler, and
riddle-reader, and moralist, and seer, and "free spirit," and almost
everything, in order to traverse the whole range of human values
and estimations, and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of eyes and
consciences to look from a height to any distance, from a depth up
to any height, from a nook into any expanse. But all these are only
preliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands something
else--it requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The philosophical workers, after
the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel, have to fix and formalize some
great existing body of valuations--that is to say, former DETERMINATIONS
OF VALUE, creations of value, which have become prevalent, and are for
a time called "truths"--whether in the domain of the LOGICAL, the
POLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC. It is for these investigators to
make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto, conspicuous,
conceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to shorten everything long,
even "time" itself, and to SUBJUGATE the entire past: an immense and
wonderful task, in the carrying out of which all refined pride, all
tenacious will, can surely find satisfaction. THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS,
HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW-GIVERS; they say: "Thus SHALL it be!"
They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind, and thereby
set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers, and all
subjugators of the past--they grasp at the future with a creative
hand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an
instrument, and a hammer. Their "knowing" is CREATING, their creating
is a law-giving, their will to truth is--WILL TO POWER.--Are there at
present such philosophers? Have there ever been such philosophers? MUST
there not be such philosophers some day? ...

212. It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a man
INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow, has ever
found himself, and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in contradiction
to the day in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of his
day. Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one
calls philosophers--who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom,
but rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators--have found
their mission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end,
however, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad conscience of
their age. In putting the vivisector's knife to the breast of the very
VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE, they have betrayed their own secret; it has been
for the sake of a NEW greatness of man, a new untrodden path to
his aggrandizement. They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy,
indolence, self-indulgence, and self-neglect, how much falsehood was
concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality, how
much virtue was OUTLIVED, they have always said "We must remove hence to
where YOU are least at home" In the face of a world of "modern ideas,"
which would like to confine every one in a corner, in a "specialty," a
philosopher, if there could be philosophers nowadays, would be compelled
to place the greatness of man, the conception of "greatness," precisely
in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness, in his all-roundness, he
would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety
of that which a man could bear and take upon himself, according to the
EXTENT to which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the
taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will, nothing is
so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently, in
the ideal of the philosopher, strength of will, sternness, and capacity
for prolonged resolution, must specially be included in the conception
of "greatness", with as good a right as the opposite doctrine, with its
ideal of a silly, renouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to
an opposite age--such as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its
accumulated energy of will, and from the wildest torrents and floods
of selfishness In the time of Socrates, among men only of worn-out
instincts, old conservative Athenians who let themselves go--"for the
sake of happiness," as they said, for the sake of pleasure, as their
conduct indicated--and who had continually on their lips the old pompous
words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led,
IRONY was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul, the wicked Socratic
assurance of the old physician and plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his
own flesh, as into the flesh and heart of the "noble," with a look that
said plainly enough "Do not dissemble before me! here--we are equal!"
At present, on the contrary, when throughout Europe the herding-animal
alone attains to honours, and dispenses honours, when "equality of
right" can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong--I mean to
say into general war against everything rare, strange, and privileged,
against the higher man, the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher
responsibility, the creative plenipotence and lordliness--at present
it belongs to the conception of "greatness" to be noble, to wish to be
apart, to be capable of being different, to stand alone, to have to live
by personal initiative, and the philosopher will betray something of his
own ideal when he asserts "He shall be the greatest who can be the most
solitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the man beyond good
and evil, the master of his virtues, and of super-abundance of will;
precisely this shall be called GREATNESS: as diversified as can be
entire, as ample as can be full." And to ask once more the question: Is
greatness POSSIBLE--nowadays?

213. It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot
be taught: one must "know" it by experience--or one should have the
pride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people all talk of things
of which they CANNOT have any experience, is true more especially
and unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical
matters:--the very few know them, are permitted to know them, and
all popular ideas about them are false. Thus, for instance, the truly
philosophical combination of a bold, exuberant spirituality which runs
at presto pace, and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no
false step, is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own
experience, and therefore, should any one speak of it in their
presence, it is incredible to them. They conceive of every necessity as
troublesome, as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint;
thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating,
almost as a trouble, and often enough as "worthy of the SWEAT of the
noble"--but not at all as something easy and divine, closely related
to dancing and exuberance! "To think" and to take a matter "seriously,"
"arduously"--that is one and the same thing to them; such only has been
their "experience."--Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they
who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything
"arbitrarily," and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom,
of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping,
reaches its climax--in short, that necessity and "freedom of will" are
then the same thing with them. There is, in fine, a gradation of rank
in psychical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems
corresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who
ventures too near them, without being predestined for their solution
by the loftiness and power of his spirituality. Of what use is it for
nimble, everyday intellects, or clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists
to press, in their plebeian ambition, close to such problems, and as
it were into this "holy of holies"--as so often happens nowadays! But
coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is provided for in
the primary law of things; the doors remain closed to those intruders,
though they may dash and break their heads thereon. People have always
to be born to a high station, or, more definitely, they have to be BRED
for it: a person has only a right to philosophy--taking the word in
its higher significance--in virtue of his descent; the ancestors, the
"blood," decide here also. Many generations must have prepared the way
for the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have been
separately acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and embodied; not only the
bold, easy, delicate course and current of his thoughts, but above all
the readiness for great responsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance
and contemning look, the feeling of separation from the multitude with
their duties and virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever
is misunderstood and calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight and
practice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of
will, the lingering eye which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely
loves....



CHAPTER VII. OUR VIRTUES


214. OUR Virtues?--It is probable that we, too, have still our virtues,
although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues on
account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a little
distance from us. We Europeans of the day after tomorrow, we firstlings
of the twentieth century--with all our dangerous curiosity, our
multifariousness and art of disguising, our mellow and seemingly
sweetened cruelty in sense and spirit--we shall presumably, IF we must
have virtues, have those only which have come to agreement with our most
secret and heartfelt inclinations, with our most ardent requirements:
well, then, let us look for them in our labyrinths!--where, as we know,
so many things lose themselves, so many things get quite lost! And is
there anything finer than to SEARCH for one's own virtues? Is it not
almost to BELIEVE in one's own virtues? But this "believing in one's
own virtues"--is it not practically the same as what was formerly called
one's "good conscience," that long, respectable pigtail of an idea,
which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads, and often enough
also behind their understandings? It seems, therefore, that however
little we may imagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherly
respectable in other respects, in one thing we are nevertheless the
worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers, we last Europeans with good
consciences: we also still wear their pigtail.--Ah! if you only knew how
soon, so very soon--it will be different!

215. As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which
determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of different
colours shine around a single planet, now with red light, now with
green, and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley
colours: so we modern men, owing to the complicated mechanism of our
"firmament," are determined by DIFFERENT moralities; our actions shine
alternately in different colours, and are seldom unequivocal--and there
are often cases, also, in which our actions are MOTLEY-COLOURED.

216. To love one's enemies? I think that has been well learnt: it takes
place thousands of times at present on a large and small scale; indeed,
at times the higher and sublimer thing takes place:--we learn to DESPISE
when we love, and precisely when we love best; all of it, however,
unconsciously, without noise, without ostentation, with the shame and
secrecy of goodness, which forbids the utterance of the pompous word
and the formula of virtue. Morality as attitude--is opposed to our taste
nowadays. This is ALSO an advance, as it was an advance in our fathers
that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their taste,
including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against religion (and all
that formerly belonged to freethinker-pantomime). It is the music in our
conscience, the dance in our spirit, to which Puritan litanies, moral
sermons, and goody-goodness won't chime.

217. Let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance
to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment!
They never forgive us if they have once made a mistake BEFORE us
(or even with REGARD to us)--they inevitably become our instinctive
calumniators and detractors, even when they still remain our
"friends."--Blessed are the forgetful: for they "get the better" even of
their blunders.

218. The psychologists of France--and where else are there still
psychologists nowadays?--have never yet exhausted their bitter and
manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise, just as though... in
short, they betray something thereby. Flaubert, for instance, the honest
citizen of Rouen, neither saw, heard, nor tasted anything else in the
end; it was his mode of self-torment and refined cruelty. As this is
growing wearisome, I would now recommend for a change something else
for a pleasure--namely, the unconscious astuteness with which good, fat,
honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks
they have to perform, the subtle, barbed, Jesuitical astuteness, which
is a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the
middle-class in its best moments--subtler even than the understanding of
its victims:--a repeated proof that "instinct" is the most intelligent
of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered. In
short, you psychologists, study the philosophy of the "rule" in its
struggle with the "exception": there you have a spectacle fit for Gods
and godlike malignity! Or, in plainer words, practise vivisection on
"good people," on the "homo bonae voluntatis," ON YOURSELVES!

219. The practice of judging and condemning morally, is the favourite
revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so, it is
also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature,
and finally, it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and BECOMING
subtle--malice spiritualises. They are glad in their inmost heart that
there is a standard according to which those who are over-endowed with
intellectual goods and privileges, are equal to them, they contend for
the "equality of all before God," and almost NEED the belief in God for
this purpose. It is among them that the most powerful antagonists of
atheism are found. If any one were to say to them "A lofty spirituality
is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely
moral man"--it would make them furious, I shall take care not to say
so. I would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality
itself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities, that it
is a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the "merely moral" man,
after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice,
perhaps during a whole series of generations, that lofty spirituality
is precisely the spiritualising of justice, and the beneficent severity
which knows that it is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in the
world, even among things--and not only among men.

220. Now that the praise of the "disinterested person" is so popular
one must--probably not without some danger--get an idea of WHAT people
actually take an interest in, and what are the things generally which
fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men--including the
cultured, even the learned, and perhaps philosophers also, if
appearances do not deceive. The fact thereby becomes obvious that the
greater part of what interests and charms higher natures, and more
refined and fastidious tastes, seems absolutely "uninteresting" to
the average man--if, notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these
interests, he calls it desinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to
act "disinterestedly." There have been philosophers who could give this
popular astonishment a seductive and mystical, other-worldly expression
(perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience?),
instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that
"disinterested" action is very interesting and "interested" action,
provided that... "And love?"--What! Even an action for love's sake
shall be "unegoistic"? But you fools--! "And the praise of the
self-sacrificer?"--But whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that
he wanted and obtained something for it--perhaps something from himself
for something from himself; that he relinquished here in order to have
more there, perhaps in general to be more, or even feel himself "more."
But this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more fastidious
spirit does not like to stay: for here truth has to stifle her yawns so
much when she is obliged to answer. And after all, truth is a woman; one
must not use force with her.

221. "It sometimes happens," said a moralistic pedant and
trifle-retailer, "that I honour and respect an unselfish man: not,
however, because he is unselfish, but because I think he has a right to
be useful to another man at his own expense. In short, the question
is always who HE is, and who THE OTHER is. For instance, in a person
created and destined for command, self-denial and modest retirement,
instead of being virtues, would be the waste of virtues: so it seems
to me. Every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself
unconditionally and appeals to every one, not only sins against good
taste, but is also an incentive to sins of omission, an ADDITIONAL
seduction under the mask of philanthropy--and precisely a seduction and
injury to the higher, rarer, and more privileged types of men. Moral
systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the GRADATIONS OF
RANK; their presumption must be driven home to their conscience--until
they thoroughly understand at last that it is IMMORAL to say that 'what
is right for one is proper for another.'"--So said my moralistic pedant
and bonhomme. Did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus
exhorted systems of morals to practise morality? But one should not be
too much in the right if one wishes to have the laughers on ONE'S OWN
side; a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste.

222. Wherever sympathy (fellow-suffering) is preached nowadays--and,
if I gather rightly, no other religion is any longer preached--let the
psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity, through all the
noise which is natural to these preachers (as to all preachers), he will
hear a hoarse, groaning, genuine note of SELF-CONTEMPT. It belongs
to the overshadowing and uglifying of Europe, which has been on
the increase for a century (the first symptoms of which are already
specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of Galiani to Madame
d'Epinay)--IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF! The man of
"modern ideas," the conceited ape, is excessively dissatisfied with
himself--this is perfectly certain. He suffers, and his vanity wants him
only "to suffer with his fellows."

223. The hybrid European--a tolerably ugly plebeian, taken all in
all--absolutely requires a costume: he needs history as a storeroom
of costumes. To be sure, he notices that none of the costumes fit him
properly--he changes and changes. Let us look at the nineteenth century
with respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades
of style, and also with respect to its moments of desperation on account
of "nothing suiting" us. It is in vain to get ourselves up as romantic,
or classical, or Christian, or Florentine, or barocco, or "national,"
in moribus et artibus: it does not "clothe us"! But the "spirit,"
especially the "historical spirit," profits even by this desperation:
once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested,
put on, taken off, packed up, and above all studied--we are the first
studious age in puncto of "costumes," I mean as concerns morals,
articles of belief, artistic tastes, and religions; we are prepared as
no other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style, for the
most spiritual festival--laughter and arrogance, for the transcendental
height of supreme folly and Aristophanic ridicule of the world. Perhaps
we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here, the
domain where even we can still be original, probably as parodists of
the world's history and as God's Merry-Andrews,--perhaps, though nothing
else of the present have a future, our laughter itself may have a
future!

224. The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly
the order of rank of the valuations according to which a people, a
community, or an individual has lived, the "divining instinct" for the
relationships of these valuations, for the relation of the authority
of the valuations to the authority of the operating forces),--this
historical sense, which we Europeans claim as our specialty, has come
to us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi-barbarity into which
Europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and
races--it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this
faculty as its sixth sense. Owing to this mingling, the past of every
form and mode of life, and of cultures which were formerly closely
contiguous and superimposed on one another, flows forth into us "modern
souls"; our instincts now run back in all directions, we ourselves are
a kind of chaos: in the end, as we have said, the spirit perceives its
advantage therein. By means of our semi-barbarity in body and in desire,
we have secret access everywhere, such as a noble age never had; we have
access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations, and to
every form of semi-barbarity that has at any time existed on earth; and
in so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto
has just been semi-barbarity, the "historical sense" implies almost the
sense and instinct for everything, the taste and tongue for everything:
whereby it immediately proves itself to be an IGNOBLE sense. For
instance, we enjoy Homer once more: it is perhaps our happiest
acquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer, whom men of
distinguished culture (as the French of the seventeenth century, like
Saint-Evremond, who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE, and even
Voltaire, the last echo of the century) cannot and could not so easily
appropriate--whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy. The very
decided Yea and Nay of their palate, their promptly ready disgust, their
hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange, their horror of
the bad taste even of lively curiosity, and in general the averseness of
every distinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desire,
a dissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what is
strange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards
the best things of the world which are not their property or could not
become their prey--and no faculty is more unintelligible to such men
than just this historical sense, with its truckling, plebeian
curiosity. The case is not different with Shakespeare, that marvelous
Spanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of taste, over whom an ancient Athenian
of the circle of AEschylus would have half-killed himself with laughter
or irritation: but we--accept precisely this wild motleyness, this
medley of the most delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial,
with a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinement
of art reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as little
disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the English
populace in which Shakespeare's art and taste lives, as perhaps on
the Chiaja of Naples, where, with all our senses awake, we go our way,
enchanted and voluntarily, in spite of the drain-odour of the lower
quarters of the town. That as men of the "historical sense" we have
our virtues, is not to be disputed:--we are unpretentious, unselfish,
modest, brave, habituated to self-control and self-renunciation, very
grateful, very patient, very complaisant--but with all this we are
perhaps not very "tasteful." Let us finally confess it, that what is
most difficult for us men of the "historical sense" to grasp, feel,
taste, and love, what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost
hostile, is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every
culture and art, the essentially noble in works and men, their moment
of smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency, the goldenness and coldness
which all things show that have perfected themselves. Perhaps our great
virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD taste,
at least to the very bad taste; and we can only evoke in ourselves
imperfectly, hesitatingly, and with compulsion the small, short, and
happy godsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here and
there: those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power has
voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite,--when a
super-abundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checking
and petrifying, by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still
trembling ground. PROPORTIONATENESS is strange to us, let us confess it
to ourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite, the
immeasurable. Like the rider on his forward panting horse, we let the
reins fall before the infinite, we modern men, we semi-barbarians--and
are only in OUR highest bliss when we--ARE IN MOST DANGER.

225. Whether it be hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or eudaemonism,
all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according
to PLEASURE and PAIN, that is, according to accompanying circumstances
and secondary considerations, are plausible modes of thought and
naivetes, which every one conscious of CREATIVE powers and an artist's
conscience will look down upon with scorn, though not without sympathy.
Sympathy for you!--to be sure, that is not sympathy as you understand
it: it is not sympathy for social "distress," for "society" with its
sick and misfortuned, for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie
on the ground around us; still less is it sympathy for the grumbling,
vexed, revolutionary slave-classes who strive after power--they call it
"freedom." OUR sympathy is a loftier and further-sighted sympathy:--we
see how MAN dwarfs himself, how YOU dwarf him! and there are moments
when we view YOUR sympathy with an indescribable anguish, when we resist
it,--when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kind
of levity. You want, if possible--and there is not a more foolish "if
possible"--TO DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING; and we?--it really seems that WE
would rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been!
Well-being, as you understand it--is certainly not a goal; it seems
to us an END; a condition which at once renders man ludicrous and
contemptible--and makes his destruction DESIRABLE! The discipline
of suffering, of GREAT suffering--know ye not that it is only THIS
discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto?
The tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energy,
its shuddering in view of rack and ruin, its inventiveness and bravery
in undergoing, enduring, interpreting, and exploiting misfortune, and
whatever depth, mystery, disguise, spirit, artifice, or greatness has
been bestowed upon the soul--has it not been bestowed through suffering,
through the discipline of great suffering? In man CREATURE and CREATOR
are united: in man there is not only matter, shred, excess, clay, mire,
folly, chaos; but there is also the creator, the sculptor, the hardness
of the hammer, the divinity of the spectator, and the seventh day--do
ye understand this contrast? And that YOUR sympathy for the "creature
in man" applies to that which has to be fashioned, bruised, forged,
stretched, roasted, annealed, refined--to that which must necessarily
SUFFER, and IS MEANT to suffer? And our sympathy--do ye not understand
what our REVERSE sympathy applies to, when it resists your sympathy as
the worst of all pampering and enervation?--So it is sympathy AGAINST
sympathy!--But to repeat it once more, there are higher problems than
the problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy; and all systems of
philosophy which deal only with these are naivetes.

226. WE IMMORALISTS.--This world with which WE are concerned, in which
we have to fear and love, this almost invisible, inaudible world of
delicate command and delicate obedience, a world of "almost" in every
respect, captious, insidious, sharp, and tender--yes, it is well
protected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity! We are
woven into a strong net and garment of duties, and CANNOT disengage
ourselves--precisely here, we are "men of duty," even we! Occasionally,
it is true, we dance in our "chains" and betwixt our "swords"; it
is none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth under the
circumstances, and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot. But
do what we will, fools and appearances say of us: "These are men WITHOUT
duty,"--we have always fools and appearances against us!

227. Honesty, granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot rid
ourselves, we free spirits--well, we will labour at it with all our
perversity and love, and not tire of "perfecting" ourselves in OUR
virtue, which alone remains: may its glance some day overspread like
a gilded, blue, mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dull
gloomy seriousness! And if, nevertheless, our honesty should one day
grow weary, and sigh, and stretch its limbs, and find us too hard, and
would fain have it pleasanter, easier, and gentler, like an agreeable
vice, let us remain HARD, we latest Stoics, and let us send to its
help whatever devilry we have in us:--our disgust at the clumsy
and undefined, our "NITIMUR IN VETITUM," our love of adventure,
our sharpened and fastidious curiosity, our most subtle, disguised,
intellectual Will to Power and universal conquest, which rambles and
roves avidiously around all the realms of the future--let us go with all
our "devils" to the help of our "God"! It is probable that people will
misunderstand and mistake us on that account: what does it matter! They
will say: "Their 'honesty'--that is their devilry, and nothing else!"
What does it matter! And even if they were right--have not all Gods
hitherto been such sanctified, re-baptized devils? And after all, what
do we know of ourselves? And what the spirit that leads us wants TO BE
CALLED? (It is a question of names.) And how many spirits we harbour?
Our honesty, we free spirits--let us be careful lest it become our
vanity, our ornament and ostentation, our limitation, our stupidity!
Every virtue inclines to stupidity, every stupidity to virtue; "stupid
to the point of sanctity," they say in Russia,--let us be careful lest
out of pure honesty we eventually become saints and bores! Is not life
a hundred times too short for us--to bore ourselves? One would have to
believe in eternal life in order to...

228. I hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy
hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporific
appliances--and that "virtue," in my opinion, has been MORE injured
by the TEDIOUSNESS of its advocates than by anything else; at the same
time, however, I would not wish to overlook their general usefulness. It
is desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals,
and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day
become interesting! But let us not be afraid! Things still remain today
as they have always been: I see no one in Europe who has (or DISCLOSES)
an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be
conducted in a dangerous, captious, and ensnaring manner--that CALAMITY
might be involved therein. Observe, for example, the indefatigable,
inevitable English utilitarians: how ponderously and respectably they
stalk on, stalk along (a Homeric metaphor expresses it better) in the
footsteps of Bentham, just as he had already stalked in the footsteps of
the respectable Helvetius! (no, he was not a dangerous man, Helvetius,
CE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE, to use an expression of Galiani). No new
thought, nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression
of an old thought, not even a proper history of what has been previously
thought on the subject: an IMPOSSIBLE literature, taking it all in all,
unless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief. In effect, the
old English vice called CANT, which is MORAL TARTUFFISM, has insinuated
itself also into these moralists (whom one must certainly read with an
eye to their motives if one MUST read them), concealed this time under
the new form of the scientific spirit; moreover, there is not absent
from them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience, from which a
race of former Puritans must naturally suffer, in all their scientific
tinkering with morals. (Is not a moralist the opposite of a Puritan?
That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable,
as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem? Is moralizing
not-immoral?) In the end, they all want English morality to be
recognized as authoritative, inasmuch as mankind, or the "general
utility," or "the happiness of the greatest number,"--no! the happiness
of ENGLAND, will be best served thereby. They would like, by all means,
to convince themselves that the striving after English happiness, I
mean after COMFORT and FASHION (and in the highest instance, a seat in
Parliament), is at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact, that
in so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto, it has
just consisted in such striving. Not one of those ponderous,
conscience-stricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate the
cause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare) wants to have
any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the "general welfare" is
no ideal, no goal, no notion that can be at all grasped, but is only a
nostrum,--that what is fair to one MAY NOT at all be fair to another,
that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to
higher men, in short, that there is a DISTINCTION OF RANK between man
and man, and consequently between morality and morality. They are an
unassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men, these utilitarian
Englishmen, and, as already remarked, in so far as they are tedious, one
cannot think highly enough of their utility. One ought even to ENCOURAGE
them, as has been partially attempted in the following rhymes:--

    Hail, ye worthies, barrow-wheeling,
    "Longer--better," aye revealing,

    Stiffer aye in head and knee;
    Unenraptured, never jesting,
    Mediocre everlasting,

    SANS GENIE ET SANS ESPRIT!


229. In these later ages, which may be proud of their humanity, there
still remains so much fear, so much SUPERSTITION of the fear, of the
"cruel wild beast," the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of
these humaner ages--that even obvious truths, as if by the agreement
of centuries, have long remained unuttered, because they have the
appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again.
I perhaps risk something when I allow such a truth to escape; let
others capture it again and give it so much "milk of pious sentiment"
[FOOTNOTE: An expression from Schiller's William Tell, Act IV, Scene
3.] to drink, that it will lie down quiet and forgotten, in its old
corner.--One ought to learn anew about cruelty, and open one's eyes;
one ought at last to learn impatience, in order that such immodest
gross errors--as, for instance, have been fostered by ancient and
modern philosophers with regard to tragedy--may no longer wander about
virtuously and boldly. Almost everything that we call "higher culture"
is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTY--this is
my thesis; the "wild beast" has not been slain at all, it lives, it
flourishes, it has only been--transfigured. That which constitutes the
painful delight of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in
so-called tragic sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime,
up to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains its
sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty. What the
Roman enjoys in the arena, the Christian in the ecstasies of the cross,
the Spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake, or of the bull-fight,
the present-day Japanese who presses his way to the tragedy, the workman
of the Parisian suburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutions,
the Wagnerienne who, with unhinged will, "undergoes" the performance of
"Tristan and Isolde"--what all these enjoy, and strive with mysterious
ardour to drink in, is the philtre of the great Circe "cruelty." Here,
to be sure, we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of
former times, which could only teach with regard to cruelty that
it originated at the sight of the suffering of OTHERS: there is an
abundant, super-abundant enjoyment even in one's own suffering, in
causing one's own suffering--and wherever man has allowed himself to be
persuaded to self-denial in the RELIGIOUS sense, or to self-mutilation,
as among the Phoenicians and ascetics, or in general, to
desensualisation, decarnalisation, and contrition, to Puritanical
repentance-spasms, to vivisection of conscience and to Pascal-like
SACRIFIZIA DELL' INTELLETO, he is secretly allured and impelled
forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill of cruelty TOWARDS
HIMSELF.--Finally, let us consider that even the seeker of knowledge
operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty, in that he compels his
spirit to perceive AGAINST its own inclination, and often enough against
the wishes of his heart:--he forces it to say Nay, where he would like
to affirm, love, and adore; indeed, every instance of taking a thing
profoundly and fundamentally, is a violation, an intentional injuring
of the fundamental will of the spirit, which instinctively aims at
appearance and superficiality,--even in every desire for knowledge there
is a drop of cruelty.

230. Perhaps what I have said here about a "fundamental will of the
spirit" may not be understood without further details; I may be allowed
a word of explanation.--That imperious something which is popularly
called "the spirit," wishes to be master internally and externally,
and to feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for a
simplicity, a binding, taming, imperious, and essentially ruling will.
Its requirements and capacities here, are the same as those assigned by
physiologists to everything that lives, grows, and multiplies. The power
of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong
tendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold,
to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it
arbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for itself
certain traits and lines in the foreign elements, in every portion of
the "outside world." Its object thereby is the incorporation of new
"experiences," the assortment of new things in the old arrangements--in
short, growth; or more properly, the FEELING of growth, the feeling of
increased power--is its object. This same will has at its service an
apparently opposed impulse of the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference
of ignorance, of arbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner
denial of this or that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive
attitude against much that is knowable, a contentment with obscurity,
with the shutting-in horizon, an acceptance and approval of ignorance:
as that which is all necessary according to the degree of its
appropriating power, its "digestive power," to speak figuratively (and
in fact "the spirit" resembles a stomach more than anything else). Here
also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be
deceived (perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so,
but is only allowed to pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and
ambiguity, an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness
and mystery, of the too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified,
the diminished, the misshapen, the beautified--an enjoyment of the
arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power. Finally, in this
connection, there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to
deceive other spirits and dissemble before them--the constant pressing
and straining of a creating, shaping, changeable power: the spirit
enjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises, it enjoys
also its feeling of security therein--it is precisely by its Protean
arts that it is best protected and concealed!--COUNTER TO this
propensity for appearance, for simplification, for a disguise, for a
cloak, in short, for an outside--for every outside is a cloak--there
operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge, which takes, and
INSISTS on taking things profoundly, variously, and thoroughly; as a
kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste, which every
courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself, provided, as it ought
to be, that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for
introspection, and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe
words. He will say: "There is something cruel in the tendency of my
spirit": let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not
so! In fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead of our cruelty, perhaps
our "extravagant honesty" were talked about, whispered about, and
glorified--we free, VERY free spirits--and some day perhaps SUCH will
actually be our--posthumous glory! Meanwhile--for there is plenty of
time until then--we should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in
such florid and fringed moral verbiage; our whole former work has
just made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance. They are
beautiful, glistening, jingling, festive words: honesty, love of truth,
love of wisdom, sacrifice for knowledge, heroism of the truthful--there
is something in them that makes one's heart swell with pride. But we
anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the
secrecy of an anchorite's conscience, that this worthy parade of
verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment, frippery, and
gold-dust of unconscious human vanity, and that even under such
flattering colour and repainting, the terrible original text HOMO NATURA
must again be recognized. In effect, to translate man back again into
nature; to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and
subordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over
the eternal original text, HOMO NATURA; to bring it about that man shall
henceforth stand before man as he now, hardened by the discipline
of science, stands before the OTHER forms of nature, with fearless
Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the enticements of old
metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to him far too long: "Thou
art more! thou art higher! thou hast a different origin!"--this may be
a strange and foolish task, but that it is a TASK, who can deny! Why did
we choose it, this foolish task? Or, to put the question differently:
"Why knowledge at all?" Every one will ask us about this. And thus
pressed, we, who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times, have
not found and cannot find any better answer....

231. Learning alters us, it does what all nourishment does that does not
merely "conserve"--as the physiologist knows. But at the bottom of our
souls, quite "down below," there is certainly something unteachable,
a granite of spiritual fate, of predetermined decision and answer to
predetermined, chosen questions. In each cardinal problem there speaks
an unchangeable "I am this"; a thinker cannot learn anew about man and
woman, for instance, but can only learn fully--he can only follow to the
end what is "fixed" about them in himself. Occasionally we find certain
solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us; perhaps they
are henceforth called "convictions." Later on--one sees in them only
footsteps to self-knowledge, guide-posts to the problem which we
ourselves ARE--or more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody,
our spiritual fate, the UNTEACHABLE in us, quite "down below."--In view
of this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself, permission
will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about
"woman as she is," provided that it is known at the outset how literally
they are merely--MY truths.

232. Woman wishes to be independent, and therefore she begins to
enlighten men about "woman as she is"--THIS is one of the worst
developments of the general UGLIFYING of Europe. For what must these
clumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self-exposure bring
to light! Woman has so much cause for shame; in woman there is so
much pedantry, superficiality, schoolmasterliness, petty presumption,
unbridledness, and indiscretion concealed--study only woman's behaviour
towards children!--which has really been best restrained and dominated
hitherto by the FEAR of man. Alas, if ever the "eternally tedious in
woman"--she has plenty of it!--is allowed to venture forth! if she
begins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and art-of
charming, of playing, of frightening away sorrow, of alleviating and
taking easily; if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable
desires! Female voices are already raised, which, by Saint Aristophanes!
make one afraid:--with medical explicitness it is stated in a
threatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from man. Is
it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to be
scientific? Enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men's affair,
men's gift--we remained therewith "among ourselves"; and in the end,
in view of all that women write about "woman," we may well have
considerable doubt as to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment
about herself--and CAN desire it. If woman does not thereby seek a new
ORNAMENT for herself--I believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally
feminine?--why, then, she wishes to make herself feared: perhaps she
thereby wishes to get the mastery. But she does not want truth--what
does woman care for truth? From the very first, nothing is more foreign,
more repugnant, or more hostile to woman than truth--her great art is
falsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess
it, we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in
woman: we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the
company of beings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our
seriousness, our gravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to
us. Finally, I ask the question: Did a woman herself ever acknowledge
profundity in a woman's mind, or justice in a woman's heart? And is it
not true that on the whole "woman" has hitherto been most despised by
woman herself, and not at all by us?--We men desire that woman should
not continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it was
man's care and the consideration for woman, when the church decreed:
mulier taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of woman when Napoleon
gave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand: mulier taceat in
politicis!--and in my opinion, he is a true friend of woman who calls
out to women today: mulier taceat de mulierel.

233. It betrays corruption of the instincts--apart from the fact that
it betrays bad taste--when a woman refers to Madame Roland, or Madame de
Stael, or Monsieur George Sand, as though something were proved thereby
in favour of "woman as she is." Among men, these are the three comical
women as they are--nothing more!--and just the best involuntary
counter-arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy.

234. Stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terrible
thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of
the house is managed! Woman does not understand what food means, and she
insists on being cook! If woman had been a thinking creature, she should
certainly, as cook for thousands of years, have discovered the most
important physiological facts, and should likewise have got possession
of the healing art! Through bad female cooks--through the entire lack
of reason in the kitchen--the development of mankind has been longest
retarded and most interfered with: even today matters are very little
better. A word to High School girls.

235. There are turns and casts of fancy, there are sentences, little
handfuls of words, in which a whole culture, a whole society suddenly
crystallises itself. Among these is the incidental remark of Madame de
Lambert to her son: "MON AMI, NE VOUS PERMETTEZ JAMAIS QUE DES FOLIES,
QUI VOUS FERONT GRAND PLAISIR"--the motherliest and wisest remark, by
the way, that was ever addressed to a son.

236. I have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what Dante and
Goethe believed about woman--the former when he sang, "ELLA GUARDAVA
SUSO, ED IO IN LEI," and the latter when he interpreted it, "the
eternally feminine draws us ALOFT"; for THIS is just what she believes
of the eternally masculine.

237.

SEVEN APOPHTHEGMS FOR WOMEN

How the longest ennui flees, When a man comes to our knees!

Age, alas! and science staid, Furnish even weak virtue aid.

Sombre garb and silence meet: Dress for every dame--discreet.

Whom I thank when in my bliss? God!--and my good tailoress!

Young, a flower-decked cavern home; Old, a dragon thence doth roam.

Noble title, leg that's fine, Man as well: Oh, were HE mine!

Speech in brief and sense in mass--Slippery for the jenny-ass!

237A. Woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds, which, losing
their way, have come down among them from an elevation: as something
delicate, fragile, wild, strange, sweet, and animating--but as something
also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away.

238. To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of "man and woman," to
deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally
hostile tension, to dream here perhaps of equal rights, equal
training, equal claims and obligations: that is a TYPICAL sign of
shallow-mindedness; and a thinker who has proved himself shallow at
this dangerous spot--shallow in instinct!--may generally be regarded as
suspicious, nay more, as betrayed, as discovered; he will probably prove
too "short" for all fundamental questions of life, future as well as
present, and will be unable to descend into ANY of the depths. On the
other hand, a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires, and
has also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and
harshness, and easily confounded with them, can only think of woman as
ORIENTALS do: he must conceive of her as a possession, as confinable
property, as a being predestined for service and accomplishing her
mission therein--he must take his stand in this matter upon the immense
rationality of Asia, upon the superiority of the instinct of Asia, as
the Greeks did formerly; those best heirs and scholars of Asia--who,
as is well known, with their INCREASING culture and amplitude of power,
from Homer to the time of Pericles, became gradually STRICTER towards
woman, in short, more Oriental. HOW necessary, HOW logical, even HOW
humanely desirable this was, let us consider for ourselves!

239. The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so
much respect by men as at present--this belongs to the tendency and
fundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as disrespectfulness to
old age--what wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of
this respect? They want more, they learn to make claims, the tribute
of respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rights,
indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is
losing modesty. And let us immediately add that she is also losing
taste. She is unlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who "unlearns to
fear" sacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture
forward when the fear-inspiring quality in man--or more definitely,
the MAN in man--is no longer either desired or fully developed, is
reasonable enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficult
to understand is that precisely thereby--woman deteriorates. This is
what is happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it!
Wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military
and aristocratic spirit, woman strives for the economic and legal
independence of a clerk: "woman as clerkess" is inscribed on the portal
of the modern society which is in course of formation. While she
thus appropriates new rights, aspires to be "master," and inscribes
"progress" of woman on her flags and banners, the very opposite realises
itself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN RETROGRADES. Since the French
Revolution the influence of woman in Europe has DECLINED in proportion
as she has increased her rights and claims; and the "emancipation of
woman," insofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves (and
not only by masculine shallow-pates), thus proves to be a remarkable
symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly
instincts. There is STUPIDITY in this movement, an almost masculine
stupidity, of which a well-reared woman--who is always a sensible
woman--might be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as to the ground
upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect exercise in
the use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man, perhaps
even "to the book," where formerly she kept herself in control and in
refined, artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man's
faith in a VEILED, fundamentally different ideal in woman, something
eternally, necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciously
dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved, cared for,
protected, and indulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and
often pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of
everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of
woman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and still
entails (as though slavery were a counter-argument, and not rather a
condition of every higher culture, of every elevation of culture):--what
does all this betoken, if not a disintegration of womanly instincts,
a defeminising? Certainly, there are enough of idiotic friends and
corrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex, who
advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate
all the stupidities from which "man" in Europe, European "manliness,"
suffers,--who would like to lower woman to "general culture," indeed
even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics. Here and there
they wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers: as
though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious
or ludicrous to a profound and godless man;--almost everywhere her
nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music
(our latest German music), and she is daily being made more hysterical
and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function, that of
bearing robust children. They wish to "cultivate" her in general still
more, and intend, as they say, to make the "weaker sex" STRONG by
culture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that
the "cultivating" of mankind and his weakening--that is to say, the
weakening, dissipating, and languishing of his FORCE OF WILL--have
always kept pace with one another, and that the most powerful and
influential women in the world (and lastly, the mother of Napoleon)
had just to thank their force of will--and not their schoolmasters--for
their power and ascendancy over men. That which inspires respect
in woman, and often enough fear also, is her NATURE, which is more
"natural" than that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning
flexibility, her tiger-claws beneath the glove, her NAIVETE in egoism,
her untrainableness and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness,
extent, and deviation of her desires and virtues. That which, in spite
of fear, excites one's sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat,
"woman," is that she seems more afflicted, more vulnerable, more
necessitous of love, and more condemned to disillusionment than any
other creature. Fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has
hitherto stood in the presence of woman, always with one foot already in
tragedy, which rends while it delights--What? And all that is now to
be at an end? And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress? The
tediousness of woman is slowly evolving? Oh Europe! Europe! We know
the horned animal which was always most attractive to thee, from which
danger is ever again threatening thee! Thy old fable might once more
become "history"--an immense stupidity might once again overmaster
thee and carry thee away! And no God concealed beneath it--no! only an
"idea," a "modern idea"!



CHAPTER VIII. PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES


240. I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagner's overture
to the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent, gorgeous, heavy,
latter-day art, which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music
as still living, in order that it may be understood:--it is an honour
to Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate! What flavours
and forces, what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! It
impresses us at one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter,
and too modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it
is not infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarse--it has fire
and courage, and at the same time the loose, dun-coloured skin of fruits
which ripen too late. It flows broad and full: and suddenly there is a
moment of inexplicable hesitation, like a gap that opens between cause
and effect, an oppression that makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but
already it broadens and widens anew, the old stream of delight--the most
manifold delight,--of old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLY
the joy of the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his
astonished, happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here
employed, the new, newly acquired, imperfectly tested expedients of art
which he apparently betrays to us. All in all, however, no beauty, no
South, nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky, nothing
of grace, no dance, hardly a will to logic; a certain clumsiness even,
which is also emphasized, as though the artist wished to say to us: "It
is part of my intention"; a cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily
barbaric and ceremonious, a flirring of learned and venerable conceits
and witticisms; something German in the best and worst sense of
the word, something in the German style, manifold, formless, and
inexhaustible; a certain German potency and super-plenitude of
soul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS of
decadence--which, perhaps, feels itself most at ease there; a real,
genuine token of the German soul, which is at the same time young and
aged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity. This kind of music
expresses best what I think of the Germans: they belong to the day
before yesterday and the day after tomorrow--THEY HAVE AS YET NO TODAY.

241. We "good Europeans," we also have hours when we allow ourselves a
warm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow
views--I have just given an example of it--hours of national excitement,
of patriotic anguish, and all other sorts of old-fashioned floods of
sentiment. Duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confines
its operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours--in a
considerable time: some in half a year, others in half a lifetime,
according to the speed and strength with which they digest and "change
their material." Indeed, I could think of sluggish, hesitating races,
which even in our rapidly moving Europe, would require half a century
ere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and
soil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say, to
"good Europeanism." And while digressing on this possibility, I
happen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two old
patriots--they were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently
spoke all the louder. "HE has as much, and knows as much, philosophy as
a peasant or a corps-student," said the one--"he is still innocent. But
what does that matter nowadays! It is the age of the masses: they lie on
their belly before everything that is massive. And so also in politicis.
A statesman who rears up for them a new Tower of Babel, some monstrosity
of empire and power, they call 'great'--what does it matter that we more
prudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief
that it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or
affair. Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position
of being obliged henceforth to practise 'high politics,' for which they
were by nature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have
to sacrifice their old and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and
doubtful mediocrity;--supposing a statesman were to condemn his people
generally to 'practise politics,' when they have hitherto had something
better to do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls
they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of
the restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the essentially
politics-practising nations;--supposing such a statesman were to
stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people, were to
make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness,
an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency, were to
depreciate their most radical proclivities, subvert their consciences,
make their minds narrow, and their tastes 'national'--what! a statesman
who should do all this, which his people would have to do penance for
throughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a statesman
would be GREAT, would he?"--"Undoubtedly!" replied the other old patriot
vehemently, "otherwise he COULD NOT have done it! It was mad perhaps to
wish such a thing! But perhaps everything great has been just as mad
at its commencement!"--"Misuse of words!" cried his interlocutor,
contradictorily--"strong! strong! Strong and mad! NOT great!"--The old
men had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their "truths" in
each other's faces, but I, in my happiness and apartness, considered how
soon a stronger one may become master of the strong, and also that
there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a
nation--namely, in the deepening of another.

242. Whether we call it "civilization," or "humanising," or "progress,"
which now distinguishes the European, whether we call it simply, without
praise or blame, by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement in
Europe--behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by
such formulas, an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS goes on, which is ever
extending the process of the assimilation of Europeans, their
increasing detachment from the conditions under which, climatically and
hereditarily, united races originate, their increasing independence of
every definite milieu, that for centuries would fain inscribe itself
with equal demands on soul and body,--that is to say, the slow emergence
of an essentially SUPER-NATIONAL and nomadic species of man, who
possesses, physiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and power
of adaptation as his typical distinction. This process of the EVOLVING
EUROPEAN, which can be retarded in its TEMPO by great relapses, but
will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth--the
still-raging storm and stress of "national sentiment" pertains to it,
and also the anarchism which is appearing at present--this process
will probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators and
panegyrists, the apostles of "modern ideas," would least care to reckon.
The same new conditions under which on an average a levelling and
mediocrising of man will take place--a useful, industrious, variously
serviceable, and clever gregarious man--are in the highest degree
suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and
attractive qualities. For, while the capacity for adaptation, which is
every day trying changing conditions, and begins a new work with every
generation, almost with every decade, makes the POWERFULNESS of the type
impossible; while the collective impression of such future Europeans
will probably be that of numerous, talkative, weak-willed, and very
handy workmen who REQUIRE a master, a commander, as they require their
daily bread; while, therefore, the democratising of Europe will tend to
the production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtle
sense of the term: the STRONG man will necessarily in individual and
exceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever
been before--owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling, owing to
the immense variety of practice, art, and disguise. I meant to say
that the democratising of Europe is at the same time an involuntary
arrangement for the rearing of TYRANTS--taking the word in all its
meanings, even in its most spiritual sense.

243. I hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the
constellation Hercules: and I hope that the men on this earth will do
like the sun. And we foremost, we good Europeans!

244. There was a time when it was customary to call Germans "deep"
by way of distinction; but now that the most successful type of new
Germanism is covetous of quite other honours, and perhaps misses
"smartness" in all that has depth, it is almost opportune and patriotic
to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that
commendation: in short, whether German depth is not at bottom something
different and worse--and something from which, thank God, we are on the
point of successfully ridding ourselves. Let us try, then, to relearn
with regard to German depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose is
a little vivisection of the German soul.--The German soul is above all
manifold, varied in its source, aggregated and super-imposed, rather
than actually built: this is owing to its origin. A German who would
embolden himself to assert: "Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast," would
make a bad guess at the truth, or, more correctly, he would come far
short of the truth about the number of souls. As a people made up of
the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a
preponderance of the pre-Aryan element as the "people of the centre" in
every sense of the term, the Germans are more intangible, more ample,
more contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more surprising,
and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves:--they
escape DEFINITION, and are thereby alone the despair of the French. It
IS characteristic of the Germans that the question: "What is German?"
never dies out among them. Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans well
enough: "We are known," they cried jubilantly to him--but Sand also
thought he knew them. Jean Paul knew what he was doing when he declared
himself incensed at Fichte's lying but patriotic flatteries and
exaggerations,--but it is probable that Goethe thought differently about
Germans from Jean Paul, even though he acknowledged him to be right with
regard to Fichte. It is a question what Goethe really thought about the
Germans?--But about many things around him he never spoke explicitly,
and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silence--probably he
had good reason for it. It is certain that it was not the "Wars of
Independence" that made him look up more joyfully, any more than it was
the French Revolution,--the event on account of which he RECONSTRUCTED
his "Faust," and indeed the whole problem of "man," was the appearance
of Napoleon. There are words of Goethe in which he condemns with
impatient severity, as from a foreign land, that which Germans take a
pride in, he once defined the famous German turn of mind as "Indulgence
towards its own and others' weaknesses." Was he wrong? it is
characteristic of Germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them.
The German soul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves,
hiding-places, and dungeons therein, its disorder has much of the charm
of the mysterious, the German is well acquainted with the bypaths to
chaos. And as everything loves its symbol, so the German loves the
clouds and all that is obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp, and
shrouded, it seems to him that everything uncertain, undeveloped,
self-displacing, and growing is "deep". The German himself does not
EXIST, he is BECOMING, he is "developing himself". "Development" is
therefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the great domain
of philosophical formulas,--a ruling idea, which, together with German
beer and German music, is labouring to Germanise all Europe. Foreigners
are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature
at the basis of the German soul propounds to them (riddles which
Hegel systematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to music).
"Good-natured and spiteful"--such a juxtaposition, preposterous in the
case of every other people, is unfortunately only too often justified
in Germany one has only to live for a while among Swabians to know this!
The clumsiness of the German scholar and his social distastefulness
agree alarmingly well with his physical rope-dancing and nimble
boldness, of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid. If any one
wishes to see the "German soul" demonstrated ad oculos, let him
only look at German taste, at German arts and manners what boorish
indifference to "taste"! How the noblest and the commonest stand there
in juxtaposition! How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution
of this soul! The German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he
experiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets "done"
with them; and German depth is often only a difficult, hesitating
"digestion." And just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like what
is convenient, so the German loves "frankness" and "honesty"; it is
so CONVENIENT to be frank and honest!--This confidingness, this
complaisance, this showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is probably the
most dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up to
nowadays: it is his proper Mephistophelean art; with this he can "still
achieve much"! The German lets himself go, and thereby gazes with
faithful, blue, empty German eyes--and other countries immediately
confound him with his dressing-gown!--I meant to say that, let "German
depth" be what it will--among ourselves alone we perhaps take the
liberty to laugh at it--we shall do well to continue henceforth to
honour its appearance and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our
old reputation as a people of depth for Prussian "smartness," and
Berlin wit and sand. It is wise for a people to pose, and LET itself
be regarded, as profound, clumsy, good-natured, honest, and foolish: it
might even be--profound to do so! Finally, we should do honour to
our name--we are not called the "TIUSCHE VOLK" (deceptive people) for
nothing....

245. The "good old" time is past, it sang itself out in Mozart--how
happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to us, that his "good
company," his tender enthusiasm, his childish delight in the Chinese and
its flourishes, his courtesy of heart, his longing for the elegant, the
amorous, the tripping, the tearful, and his belief in the South, can
still appeal to SOMETHING LEFT in us! Ah, some time or other it will be
over with it!--but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with
the intelligence and taste for Beethoven! For he was only the last echo
of a break and transition in style, and NOT, like Mozart, the last echo
of a great European taste which had existed for centuries. Beethoven
is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly
breaking down, and a future over-young soul that is always COMING;
there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal
extravagant hope,--the same light in which Europe was bathed when it
dreamed with Rousseau, when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the
Revolution, and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon.
But how rapidly does THIS very sentiment now pale, how difficult
nowadays is even the APPREHENSION of this sentiment, how strangely does
the language of Rousseau, Schiller, Shelley, and Byron sound to our ear,
in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe was able to SPEAK, which
knew how to SING in Beethoven!--Whatever German music came afterwards,
belongs to Romanticism, that is to say, to a movement which,
historically considered, was still shorter, more fleeting, and more
superficial than that great interlude, the transition of Europe from
Rousseau to Napoleon, and to the rise of democracy. Weber--but what do
WE care nowadays for "Freischutz" and "Oberon"! Or Marschner's "Hans
Heiling" and "Vampyre"! Or even Wagner's "Tannhauser"! That is extinct,
although not yet forgotten music. This whole music of Romanticism,
besides, was not noble enough, was not musical enough, to maintain its
position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses; from the
beginning it was second-rate music, which was little thought of by
genuine musicians. It was different with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon
master, who, on account of his lighter, purer, happier soul, quickly
acquired admiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautiful
EPISODE of German music. But with regard to Robert Schumann, who took
things seriously, and has been taken seriously from the first--he
was the last that founded a school,--do we not now regard it as a
satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very Romanticism
of Schumann's has been surmounted? Schumann, fleeing into the "Saxon
Switzerland" of his soul, with a half Werther-like, half Jean-Paul-like
nature (assuredly not like Beethoven! assuredly not like Byron!)--his
MANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of
injustice; Schumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a PETTY
taste (that is to say, a dangerous propensity--doubly dangerous among
Germans--for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings), going
constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble weakling who
revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow, from the beginning
a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGERE--this Schumann was already merely a
GERMAN event in music, and no longer a European event, as Beethoven had
been, as in a still greater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German
music was threatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE
FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.

246. What a torture are books written in German to a reader who has a
THIRD ear! How indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp
of sounds without tune and rhythms without dance, which Germans call
a "book"! And even the German who READS books! How lazily, how
reluctantly, how badly he reads! How many Germans know, and consider it
obligatory to know, that there is ART in every good sentence--art which
must be divined, if the sentence is to be understood! If there is a
misunderstanding about its TEMPO, for instance, the sentence itself
is misunderstood! That one must not be doubtful about the
rhythm-determining syllables, that one should feel the breaking of the
too-rigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm, that one should lend a
fine and patient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO, that one should
divine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs, and how
delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of
their arrangement--who among book-reading Germans is complaisant enough
to recognize such duties and requirements, and to listen to so much art
and intention in language? After all, one just "has no ear for it";
and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard, and the most
delicate artistry is as it were SQUANDERED on the deaf.--These were my
thoughts when I noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters in
the art of prose-writing have been confounded: one, whose words drop
down hesitatingly and coldly, as from the roof of a damp cave--he counts
on their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates his language
like a flexible sword, and from his arm down into his toes feels the
dangerous bliss of the quivering, over-sharp blade, which wishes to
bite, hiss, and cut.

247. How little the German style has to do with harmony and with the
ear, is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves
write badly. The German does not read aloud, he does not read for the
ear, but only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer for
the time. In antiquity when a man read--which was seldom enough--he read
something to himself, and in a loud voice; they were surprised when
any one read silently, and sought secretly the reason of it. In a
loud voice: that is to say, with all the swellings, inflections, and
variations of key and changes of TEMPO, in which the ancient PUBLIC
world took delight. The laws of the written style were then the same
as those of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on the
surprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx;
partly on the strength, endurance, and power of the ancient lungs. In
the ancient sense, a period is above all a physiological whole, inasmuch
as it is comprised in one breath. Such periods as occur in Demosthenes
and Cicero, swelling twice and sinking twice, and all in one breath,
were pleasures to the men of ANTIQUITY, who knew by their own schooling
how to appreciate the virtue therein, the rareness and the difficulty
in the deliverance of such a period;--WE have really no right to the
BIG period, we modern men, who are short of breath in every sense! Those
ancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti in speaking, consequently
connoisseurs, consequently critics--they thus brought their orators to
the highest pitch; in the same manner as in the last century, when all
Italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing, the virtuosoship of song
(and with it also the art of melody) reached its elevation. In Germany,
however (until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began
shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings), there was
properly speaking only one kind of public and APPROXIMATELY artistical
discourse--that delivered from the pulpit. The preacher was the only one
in Germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word, in what manner a
sentence strikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a close; he alone
had a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for reasons
are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom
attained by a German, or almost always too late. The masterpiece of
German prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of its
greatest preacher: the BIBLE has hitherto been the best German
book. Compared with Luther's Bible, almost everything else is merely
"literature"--something which has not grown in Germany, and therefore
has not taken and does not take root in German hearts, as the Bible has
done.

248. There are two kinds of geniuses: one which above all engenders and
seeks to engender, and another which willingly lets itself be fructified
and brings forth. And similarly, among the gifted nations, there are
those on whom the woman's problem of pregnancy has devolved, and the
secret task of forming, maturing, and perfecting--the Greeks, for
instance, were a nation of this kind, and so are the French; and others
which have to fructify and become the cause of new modes of life--like
the Jews, the Romans, and, in all modesty be it asked: like the
Germans?--nations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and
irresistibly forced out of themselves, amorous and longing for
foreign races (for such as "let themselves be fructified"), and withal
imperious, like everything conscious of being full of generative force,
and consequently empowered "by the grace of God." These two kinds of
geniuses seek each other like man and woman; but they also misunderstand
each other--like man and woman.

249. Every nation has its own "Tartuffery," and calls that its
virtue.--One does not know--cannot know, the best that is in one.

250. What Europe owes to the Jews?--Many things, good and bad, and above
all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst: the grand
style in morality, the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands, of
infinite significations, the whole Romanticism and sublimity of moral
questionableness--and consequently just the most attractive, ensnaring,
and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to life,
in the aftersheen of which the sky of our European culture, its evening
sky, now glows--perhaps glows out. For this, we artists among the
spectators and philosophers, are--grateful to the Jews.

251. It must be taken into the bargain, if various clouds and
disturbances--in short, slight attacks of stupidity--pass over the
spirit of a people that suffers and WANTS to suffer from national
nervous fever and political ambition: for instance, among present-day
Germans there is alternately the anti-French folly, the anti-Semitic
folly, the anti-Polish folly, the Christian-romantic folly, the
Wagnerian folly, the Teutonic folly, the Prussian folly (just look at
those poor historians, the Sybels and Treitschkes, and their closely
bandaged heads), and whatever else these little obscurations of the
German spirit and conscience may be called. May it be forgiven me that
I, too, when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground, did not
remain wholly exempt from the disease, but like every one else, began
to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern me--the first
symptom of political infection. About the Jews, for instance, listen
to the following:--I have never yet met a German who was favourably
inclined to the Jews; and however decided the repudiation of actual
anti-Semitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men, this
prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the
sentiment itself, but only against its dangerous excess, and especially
against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of
sentiment;--on this point we must not deceive ourselves. That Germany
has amply SUFFICIENT Jews, that the German stomach, the German blood,
has difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing only of this
quantity of "Jew"--as the Italian, the Frenchman, and the Englishman
have done by means of a stronger digestion:--that is the unmistakable
declaration and language of a general instinct, to which one must listen
and according to which one must act. "Let no more Jews come in! And shut
the doors, especially towards the East (also towards Austria)!"--thus
commands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and
uncertain, so that it could be easily wiped out, easily extinguished, by
a stronger race. The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest,
toughest, and purest race at present living in Europe, they know how
to succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better than under
favourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort, which one would like
nowadays to label as vices--owing above all to a resolute faith which
does not need to be ashamed before "modern ideas", they alter only,
WHEN they do alter, in the same way that the Russian Empire makes
its conquest--as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of
yesterday--namely, according to the principle, "as slowly as possible"!
A thinker who has the future of Europe at heart, will, in all his
perspectives concerning the future, calculate upon the Jews, as he
will calculate upon the Russians, as above all the surest and likeliest
factors in the great play and battle of forces. That which is at present
called a "nation" in Europe, and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATA
(indeed, sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA), is in
every case something evolving, young, easily displaced, and not yet
a race, much less such a race AERE PERENNUS, as the Jews are such
"nations" should most carefully avoid all hot-headed rivalry and
hostility! It is certain that the Jews, if they desired--or if they
were driven to it, as the anti-Semites seem to wish--COULD now have the
ascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over Europe, that they are NOT
working and planning for that end is equally certain. Meanwhile, they
rather wish and desire, even somewhat importunely, to be insorbed and
absorbed by Europe, they long to be finally settled, authorized, and
respected somewhere, and wish to put an end to the nomadic life, to the
"wandering Jew",--and one should certainly take account of this impulse
and tendency, and MAKE ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation
of the Jewish instincts) for which purpose it would perhaps be useful
and fair to banish the anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country. One
should make advances with all prudence, and with selection, pretty much
as the English nobility do It stands to reason that the more powerful
and strongly marked types of new Germanism could enter into relation
with the Jews with the least hesitation, for instance, the nobleman
officer from the Prussian border it would be interesting in many ways
to see whether the genius for money and patience (and especially some
intellect and intellectuality--sadly lacking in the place referred to)
could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of
commanding and obeying--for both of which the country in question has
now a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break off my festal
discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have already reached my
SERIOUS TOPIC, the "European problem," as I understand it, the rearing
of a new ruling caste for Europe.

252. They are not a philosophical race--the English: Bacon represents an
ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally, Hobbes, Hume, and Locke,
an abasement, and a depreciation of the idea of a "philosopher" for more
than a century. It was AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself;
it was Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said, "JE MEPRISE LOCKE"; in the
struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world,
Hegel and Schopenhauer (along with Goethe) were of one accord; the
two hostile brother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different
directions towards the opposite poles of German thought, and thereby
wronged each other as only brothers will do.--What is lacking in
England, and has always been lacking, that half-actor and rhetorician
knew well enough, the absurd muddle-head, Carlyle, who sought to conceal
under passionate grimaces what he knew about himself: namely, what was
LACKING in Carlyle--real POWER of intellect, real DEPTH of intellectual
perception, in short, philosophy. It is characteristic of such an
unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianity--they NEED its
discipline for "moralizing" and humanizing. The Englishman, more gloomy,
sensual, headstrong, and brutal than the German--is for that very
reason, as the baser of the two, also the most pious: he has all the
MORE NEED of Christianity. To finer nostrils, this English Christianity
itself has still a characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic
excess, for which, owing to good reasons, it is used as an antidote--the
finer poison to neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning is
in fact a step in advance with coarse-mannered people, a step towards
spiritualization. The English coarseness and rustic demureness is still
most satisfactorily disguised by Christian pantomime, and by praying
and psalm-singing (or, more correctly, it is thereby explained and
differently expressed); and for the herd of drunkards and rakes who
formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of Methodism (and
more recently as the "Salvation Army"), a penitential fit may really be
the relatively highest manifestation of "humanity" to which they can
be elevated: so much may reasonably be admitted. That, however, which
offends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of music, to speak
figuratively (and also literally): he has neither rhythm nor dance in
the movements of his soul and body; indeed, not even the desire for
rhythm and dance, for "music." Listen to him speaking; look at the most
beautiful Englishwoman WALKING--in no country on earth are there more
beautiful doves and swans; finally, listen to them singing! But I ask
too much...

253. There are truths which are best recognized by mediocre minds,
because they are best adapted for them, there are truths which only
possess charms and seductive power for mediocre spirits:--one is pushed
to this probably unpleasant conclusion, now that the influence of
respectable but mediocre Englishmen--I may mention Darwin, John
Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer--begins to gain the ascendancy in the
middle-class region of European taste. Indeed, who could doubt that it
is a useful thing for SUCH minds to have the ascendancy for a time? It
would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently
soaring minds as specially qualified for determining and collecting many
little common facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptions,
they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards
those who are "the rules." After all, they have more to do than merely
to perceive:--in effect, they have to BE something new, they have to
SIGNIFY something new, they have to REPRESENT new values! The gulf
between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater, and also more
mysterious, than one thinks: the capable man in the grand style, the
creator, will possibly have to be an ignorant person;--while on the
other hand, for scientific discoveries like those of Darwin, a certain
narrowness, aridity, and industrious carefulness (in short, something
English) may not be unfavourable for arriving at them.--Finally, let
it not be forgotten that the English, with their profound mediocrity,
brought about once before a general depression of European intelligence.

What is called "modern ideas," or "the ideas of the eighteenth century,"
or "French ideas"--that, consequently, against which the GERMAN mind
rose up with profound disgust--is of English origin, there is no doubt
about it. The French were only the apes and actors of these ideas, their
best soldiers, and likewise, alas! their first and profoundest VICTIMS;
for owing to the diabolical Anglomania of "modern ideas," the AME
FRANCAIS has in the end become so thin and emaciated, that at present
one recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, its profound,
passionate strength, its inventive excellency, almost with disbelief.
One must, however, maintain this verdict of historical justice in
a determined manner, and defend it against present prejudices and
appearances: the European NOBLESSE--of sentiment, taste, and manners,
taking the word in every high sense--is the work and invention of
FRANCE; the European ignobleness, the plebeianism of modern ideas--is
ENGLAND'S work and invention.

254. Even at present France is still the seat of the most intellectual
and refined culture of Europe, it is still the high school of taste; but
one must know how to find this "France of taste." He who belongs to it
keeps himself well concealed:--they may be a small number in whom it
lives and is embodied, besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon
the strongest legs, in part fatalists, hypochondriacs, invalids, in
part persons over-indulged, over-refined, such as have the AMBITION to
conceal themselves.

They have all something in common: they keep their ears closed in
presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic
BOURGEOIS. In fact, a besotted and brutalized France at present sprawls
in the foreground--it recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste,
and at the same time of self-admiration, at the funeral of Victor Hugo.
There is also something else common to them: a predilection to resist
intellectual Germanizing--and a still greater inability to do so!
In this France of intellect, which is also a France of pessimism,
Schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more indigenous than
he has ever been in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine, who has
long ago been re-incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists
of Paris; or of Hegel, who at present, in the form of Taine--the FIRST
of living historians--exercises an almost tyrannical influence. As
regards Richard Wagner, however, the more French music learns to
adapt itself to the actual needs of the AME MODERNE, the more will it
"Wagnerite"; one can safely predict that beforehand,--it is already
taking place sufficiently! There are, however, three things which the
French can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession,
and as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority
in Europe, in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing and
vulgarizing of taste. FIRSTLY, the capacity for artistic emotion, for
devotion to "form," for which the expression, L'ART POUR L'ART, along
with numerous others, has been invented:--such capacity has not been
lacking in France for three centuries; and owing to its reverence for
the "small number," it has again and again made a sort of chamber
music of literature possible, which is sought for in vain elsewhere
in Europe.--The SECOND thing whereby the French can lay claim to
a superiority over Europe is their ancient, many-sided, MORALISTIC
culture, owing to which one finds on an average, even in the petty
ROMANCIERS of the newspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS, a
psychological sensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one
has no conception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in Germany.
The Germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite
thereto, which, as we have said, France has not grudged: those who call
the Germans "naive" on that account give them commendation for a defect.
(As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE
PSYCHOLOGICA, which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness
of German intercourse,--and as the most successful expression of
genuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate
thrills, Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory and
forerunning man, who, with a Napoleonic TEMPO, traversed HIS Europe,
in fact, several centuries of the European soul, as a surveyor and
discoverer thereof:--it has required two generations to OVERTAKE him
one way or other, to divine long afterwards some of the riddles
that perplexed and enraptured him--this strange Epicurean and man of
interrogation, the last great psychologist of France).--There is yet
a THIRD claim to superiority: in the French character there is a
successful half-way synthesis of the North and South, which makes them
comprehend many things, and enjoins upon them other things, which an
Englishman can never comprehend. Their temperament, turned alternately
to and from the South, in which from time to time the Provencal and
Ligurian blood froths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northern
grey-in-grey, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty of
blood--our GERMAN infirmity of taste, for the excessive prevalence
of which at the present moment, blood and iron, that is to say "high
politics," has with great resolution been prescribed (according to
a dangerous healing art, which bids me wait and wait, but not yet
hope).--There is also still in France a pre-understanding and
ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men, who are too
comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism, and
know how to love the South when in the North and the North when in the
South--the born Midlanders, the "good Europeans." For them BIZET
has made music, this latest genius, who has seen a new beauty and
seduction,--who has discovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC.

255. I hold that many precautions should be taken against German music.
Suppose a person loves the South as I love it--as a great school
of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills, as a
boundless solar profusion and effulgence which o'erspreads a sovereign
existence believing in itself--well, such a person will learn to be
somewhat on his guard against German music, because, in injuring his
taste anew, it will also injure his health anew. Such a Southerner, a
Southerner not by origin but by BELIEF, if he should dream of the future
of music, must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the
North; and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and
perhaps more perverse and mysterious music, a super-German music, which
does not fade, pale, and die away, as all German music does, at the
sight of the blue, wanton sea and the Mediterranean clearness of sky--a
super-European music, which holds its own even in presence of the brown
sunsets of the desert, whose soul is akin to the palm-tree, and can be
at home and can roam with big, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey... I
could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew
nothing more of good and evil; only that here and there perhaps some
sailor's home-sickness, some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might
sweep lightly over it; an art which, from the far distance, would see
the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL world fleeing
towards it, and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to
receive such belated fugitives.

256. Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze has
induced and still induces among the nations of Europe, owing also to the
short-sighted and hasty-handed politicians, who with the help of this
craze, are at present in power, and do not suspect to what extent the
disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude
policy--owing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable
at present, the most unmistakable signs that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONE,
are now overlooked, or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted. With all
the more profound and large-minded men of this century, the real general
tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way
for that new SYNTHESIS, and tentatively to anticipate the European of
the future; only in their simulations, or in their weaker moments, in
old age perhaps, did they belong to the "fatherlands"--they only rested
from themselves when they became "patriots." I think of such men as
Napoleon, Goethe, Beethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer: it
must not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them, about
whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings
(geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves),
still less, of course, by the unseemly noise with which he is now
resisted and opposed in France: the fact remains, nevertheless, that
Richard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forties, are
most closely and intimately related to one another. They are akin,
fundamentally akin, in all the heights and depths of their requirements;
it is Europe, the ONE Europe, whose soul presses urgently and longingly,
outwards and upwards, in their multifarious and boisterous art--whither?
into a new light? towards a new sun? But who would attempt to express
accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not
express distinctly? It is certain that the same storm and stress
tormented them, that they SOUGHT in the same manner, these last great
seekers! All of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ears--the
first artists of universal literary culture--for the most part even
themselves writers, poets, intermediaries and blenders of the arts and
the senses (Wagner, as musician is reckoned among painters, as poet
among musicians, as artist generally among actors); all of them fanatics
for EXPRESSION "at any cost"--I specially mention Delacroix, the nearest
related to Wagner; all of them great discoverers in the realm of the
sublime, also of the loathsome and dreadful, still greater discoverers
in effect, in display, in the art of the show-shop; all of them talented
far beyond their genius, out and out VIRTUOSI, with mysterious accesses
to all that seduces, allures, constrains, and upsets; born enemies of
logic and of the straight line, hankering after the strange, the
exotic, the monstrous, the crooked, and the self-contradictory; as men,
Tantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus, who knew themselves to be
incapable of a noble TEMPO or of a LENTO in life and action--think
of Balzac, for instance,--unrestrained workers, almost destroying
themselves by work; antinomians and rebels in manners, ambitious and
insatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment; all of them finally
shattering and sinking down at the Christian cross (and with right
and reason, for who of them would have been sufficiently profound and
sufficiently original for an ANTI-CHRISTIAN philosophy?);--on the
whole, a boldly daring, splendidly overbearing, high-flying, and
aloft-up-dragging class of higher men, who had first to teach their
century--and it is the century of the MASSES--the conception "higher
man."... Let the German friends of Richard Wagner advise together as to
whether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art, or whether
its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from SUPER-GERMAN
sources and impulses: in which connection it may not be underrated
how indispensable Paris was to the development of his type, which the
strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most
decisive time--and how the whole style of his proceedings, of his
self-apostolate, could only perfect itself in sight of the French
socialistic original. On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be
found, to the honour of Richard Wagner's German nature, that he has
acted in everything with more strength, daring, severity, and elevation
than a nineteenth-century Frenchman could have done--owing to the
circumstance that we Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the
French;--perhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is
not only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and
inimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfried,
that VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too hard, too
cheerful, too healthy, too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow
civilized nations. He may even have been a sin against Romanticism, this
anti-Latin Siegfried: well, Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old
sad days, when--anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into
politics--he began, with the religious vehemence peculiar to him, to
preach, at least, THE WAY TO ROME, if not to walk therein.--That
these last words may not be misunderstood, I will call to my aid a few
powerful rhymes, which will even betray to less delicate ears what I
mean--what I mean COUNTER TO the "last Wagner" and his Parsifal music:--

--Is this our mode?--From German heart came this vexed ululating? From
German body, this self-lacerating? Is ours this priestly hand-dilation,
This incense-fuming exaltation? Is ours this faltering, falling,
shambling, This quite uncertain ding-dong-dangling? This sly
nun-ogling, Ave-hour-bell ringing, This wholly false enraptured
heaven-o'erspringing?--Is this our mode?--Think well!--ye still wait for
admission--For what ye hear is ROME--ROME'S FAITH BY INTUITION!



CHAPTER IX. WHAT IS NOBLE?


257. EVERY elevation of the type "man," has hitherto been the work of an
aristocratic society and so it will always be--a society believing in
a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human
beings, and requiring slavery in some form or other. Without the PATHOS
OF DISTANCE, such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classes,
out of the constant out-looking and down-looking of the ruling caste on
subordinates and instruments, and out of their equally constant
practice of obeying and commanding, of keeping down and keeping at a
distance--that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen, the
longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself,
the formation of ever higher, rarer, further, more extended, more
comprehensive states, in short, just the elevation of the type "man,"
the continued "self-surmounting of man," to use a moral formula in
a supermoral sense. To be sure, one must not resign oneself to
any humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of an
aristocratic society (that is to say, of the preliminary condition for
the elevation of the type "man"): the truth is hard. Let us acknowledge
unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has ORIGINATED!
Men with a still natural nature, barbarians in every terrible sense of
the word, men of prey, still in possession of unbroken strength of will
and desire for power, threw themselves upon weaker, more moral, more
peaceful races (perhaps trading or cattle-rearing communities), or upon
old mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickering
out in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity. At the commencement,
the noble caste was always the barbarian caste: their superiority did
not consist first of all in their physical, but in their psychical
power--they were more COMPLETE men (which at every point also implies
the same as "more complete beasts").

258. Corruption--as the indication that anarchy threatens to break out
among the instincts, and that the foundation of the emotions, called
"life," is convulsed--is something radically different according to
the organization in which it manifests itself. When, for instance, an
aristocracy like that of France at the beginning of the Revolution,
flung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself
to an excess of its moral sentiments, it was corruption:--it was really
only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuries,
by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its
lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty (in
the end even to its decoration and parade-dress). The essential thing,
however, in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard
itself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth, but
as the SIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereof--that it should
therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion
of individuals, who, FOR ITS SAKE, must be suppressed and reduced to
imperfect men, to slaves and instruments. Its fundamental belief must
be precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for its own sake, but
only as a foundation and scaffolding, by means of which a select class
of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties, and
in general to a higher EXISTENCE: like those sun-seeking climbing plants
in Java--they are called Sipo Matador,--which encircle an oak so
long and so often with their arms, until at last, high above it, but
supported by it, they can unfold their tops in the open light, and
exhibit their happiness.

259. To refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from exploitation,
and put one's will on a par with that of others: this may result in a
certain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary
conditions are given (namely, the actual similarity of the individuals
in amount of force and degree of worth, and their co-relation within one
organization). As soon, however, as one wished to take this principle
more generally, and if possible even as the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF
SOCIETY, it would immediately disclose what it really is--namely, a Will
to the DENIAL of life, a principle of dissolution and decay. Here one
must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental
weakness: life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation, injury, conquest
of the strange and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of
peculiar forms, incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest,
exploitation;--but why should one for ever use precisely these words
on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped? Even the
organization within which, as was previously supposed, the
individuals treat each other as equal--it takes place in every
healthy aristocracy--must itself, if it be a living and not a dying
organization, do all that towards other bodies, which the individuals
within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the
incarnated Will to Power, it will endeavour to grow, to gain ground,
attract to itself and acquire ascendancy--not owing to any morality or
immorality, but because it LIVES, and because life IS precisely Will to
Power. On no point, however, is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans
more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter, people now rave
everywhere, even under the guise of science, about coming conditions of
society in which "the exploiting character" is to be absent--that sounds
to my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which should
refrain from all organic functions. "Exploitation" does not belong to a
depraved, or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of
the living being as a primary organic function, it is a consequence
of the intrinsic Will to Power, which is precisely the Will to
Life--Granting that as a theory this is a novelty--as a reality it is
the FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let us be so far honest towards
ourselves!

260. In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have
hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, I found certain traits
recurring regularly together, and connected with one another, until
finally two primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical
distinction was brought to light. There is MASTER-MORALITY and
SLAVE-MORALITY,--I would at once add, however, that in all higher and
mixed civilizations, there are also attempts at the reconciliation of
the two moralities, but one finds still oftener the confusion and
mutual misunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close
juxtaposition--even in the same man, within one soul. The distinctions
of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly
conscious of being different from the ruled--or among the ruled class,
the slaves and dependents of all sorts. In the first case, when it is
the rulers who determine the conception "good," it is the exalted, proud
disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that
which determines the order of rank. The noble type of man separates
from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud
disposition displays itself he despises them. Let it at once be noted
that in this first kind of morality the antithesis "good" and "bad"
means practically the same as "noble" and "despicable",--the antithesis
"good" and "EVIL" is of a different origin. The cowardly, the timid, the
insignificant, and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised;
moreover, also, the distrustful, with their constrained glances, the
self-abasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused,
the mendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:--it is a fundamental
belief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful. "We
truthful ones"--the nobility in ancient Greece called themselves. It is
obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first
applied to MEN; and were only derivatively and at a later period applied
to ACTIONS; it is a gross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals
start with questions like, "Why have sympathetic actions been praised?"
The noble type of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he
does not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: "What is
injurious to me is injurious in itself;" he knows that it is he himself
only who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES. He
honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals
self-glorification. In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude,
of power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the
consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:--the noble
man also helps the unfortunate, but not--or scarcely--out of pity, but
rather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. The
noble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power
over himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who
takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has
reverence for all that is severe and hard. "Wotan placed a hard heart in
my breast," says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is thus rightly expressed
from the soul of a proud Viking. Such a type of man is even proud of not
being made for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly:
"He who has not a hard heart when young, will never have one." The noble
and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality
which sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others,
or in DESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith
in oneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards
"selflessness," belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a careless
scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the "warm heart."--It
is the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is their art, their domain
for invention. The profound reverence for age and for tradition--all law
rests on this double reverence,--the belief and prejudice in favour of
ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of
the powerful; and if, reversely, men of "modern ideas" believe almost
instinctively in "progress" and the "future," and are more and more
lacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these "ideas" has
complacently betrayed itself thereby. A morality of the ruling class,
however, is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day taste
in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one's
equals; that one may act towards beings of a lower rank, towards all
that is foreign, just as seems good to one, or "as the heart desires,"
and in any case "beyond good and evil": it is here that sympathy and
similar sentiments can have a place. The ability and obligation to
exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge--both only within the
circle of equals,--artfulness in retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea
in friendship, a certain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the
emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance--in fact, in order to be
a good FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble
morality, which, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of "modern
ideas," and is therefore at present difficult to realize, and also to
unearth and disclose.--It is otherwise with the second type of morality,
SLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that the abused, the oppressed, the suffering,
the unemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves should
moralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates?
Probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of
man will find expression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together with
his situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the
powerful; he has a skepticism and distrust, a REFINEMENT of distrust of
everything "good" that is there honoured--he would fain persuade himself
that the very happiness there is not genuine. On the other hand, THOSE
qualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are
brought into prominence and flooded with light; it is here that
sympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence,
humility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the most
useful qualities, and almost the only means of supporting the burden of
existence. Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility.
Here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis "good" and
"evil":--power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil,
a certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which do not admit of
being despised. According to slave-morality, therefore, the "evil" man
arouses fear; according to master-morality, it is precisely the "good"
man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man is
regarded as the despicable being. The contrast attains its maximum when,
in accordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality, a shade
of depreciation--it may be slight and well-intentioned--at last attaches
itself to the "good" man of this morality; because, according to the
servile mode of thought, the good man must in any case be the SAFE
man: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little stupid, un
bonhomme. Everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy, language
shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words "good"
and "stupid."--A last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOM,
the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty
belong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice and
enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an
aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.--Hence we can understand
without further detail why love AS A PASSION--it is our European
specialty--must absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known, its
invention is due to the Provencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant,
ingenious men of the "gai saber," to whom Europe owes so much, and
almost owes itself.

261. Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for
a noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where another
kind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. The problem for him is
to represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of
themselves which they themselves do not possess--and consequently also
do not "deserve,"--and who yet BELIEVE in this good opinion
afterwards. This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so
self-disrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable,
that he would like to consider vanity an exception, and is doubtful
about it in most cases when it is spoken of. He will say, for
instance: "I may be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand
may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others
precisely as I rate it:--that, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit,
or, in most cases, that which is called 'humility,' and also
'modesty')." Or he will even say: "For many reasons I can delight in
the good opinion of others, perhaps because I love and honour them,
and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because their good opinion
endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion, perhaps
because the good opinion of others, even in cases where I do not share
it, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness:--all this, however,
is not vanity." The man of noble character must first bring it home
forcibly to his mind, especially with the aid of history, that, from
time immemorial, in all social strata in any way dependent, the ordinary
man WAS only that which he PASSED FOR:--not being at all accustomed to
fix values, he did not assign even to himself any other value than that
which his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS to
create values). It may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinary
atavism, that the ordinary man, even at present, is still always WAITING
for an opinion about himself, and then instinctively submitting himself
to it; yet by no means only to a "good" opinion, but also to a bad
and unjust one (think, for instance, of the greater part of the
self-appreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learn
from their confessors, and which in general the believing Christian
learns from his Church). In fact, conformably to the slow rise of the
democratic social order (and its cause, the blending of the blood
of masters and slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse of
the masters to assign a value to themselves and to "think well" of
themselves, will now be more and more encouraged and extended; but
it has at all times an older, ampler, and more radically ingrained
propensity opposed to it--and in the phenomenon of "vanity" this older
propensity overmasters the younger. The vain person rejoices over EVERY
good opinion which he hears about himself (quite apart from the point
of view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its truth or
falsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he subjects
himself to both, he feels himself subjected to both, by that oldest
instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.--It is "the slave"
in the vain man's blood, the remains of the slave's craftiness--and how
much of the "slave" is still left in woman, for instance!--which
seeks to SEDUCE to good opinions of itself; it is the slave, too, who
immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions, as
though he had not called them forth.--And to repeat it again: vanity is
an atavism.

262. A SPECIES originates, and a type becomes established and strong in
the long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE conditions. On
the other hand, it is known by the experience of breeders that species
which receive super-abundant nourishment, and in general a surplus of
protection and care, immediately tend in the most marked way to develop
variations, and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities (also in
monstrous vices). Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth, say
an ancient Greek polis, or Venice, as a voluntary or involuntary
contrivance for the purpose of REARING human beings; there are there men
beside one another, thrown upon their own resources, who want to make
their species prevail, chiefly because they MUST prevail, or else
run the terrible danger of being exterminated. The favour, the
super-abundance, the protection are there lacking under which variations
are fostered; the species needs itself as species, as something which,
precisely by virtue of its hardness, its uniformity, and simplicity of
structure, can in general prevail and make itself permanent in
constant struggle with its neighbours, or with rebellious or
rebellion-threatening vassals. The most varied experience teaches it
what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that
it still exists, in spite of all Gods and men, and has hitherto been
victorious: these qualities it calls virtues, and these virtues alone
it develops to maturity. It does so with severity, indeed it desires
severity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education
of youth, in the control of women, in the marriage customs, in the
relations of old and young, in the penal laws (which have an eye only
for the degenerating): it counts intolerance itself among the virtues,
under the name of "justice." A type with few, but very marked features,
a species of severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and reticent
men (and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and
nuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the vicissitudes
of generations; the constant struggle with uniform UNFAVOURABLE
conditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a type becoming
stable and hard. Finally, however, a happy state of things results, the
enormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more enemies among the
neighbouring peoples, and the means of life, even of the enjoyment
of life, are present in superabundance. With one stroke the bond and
constraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer regarded as
necessary, as a condition of existence--if it would continue, it can
only do so as a form of LUXURY, as an archaizing TASTE. Variations,
whether they be deviations (into the higher, finer, and rarer), or
deteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the scene in the
greatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be individual
and detach himself. At this turning-point of history there manifest
themselves, side by side, and often mixed and entangled together, a
magnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving, a
kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth, and an extraordinary
decay and self-destruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly
exploding egoisms, which strive with one another "for sun and light,"
and can no longer assign any limit, restraint, or forbearance for
themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality. It was this
morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously, which bent
the bow in so threatening a manner:--it is now "out of date," it is
getting "out of date." The dangerous and disquieting point has been
reached when the greater, more manifold, more comprehensive life IS
LIVED BEYOND the old morality; the "individual" stands out, and is
obliged to have recourse to his own law-giving, his own arts and
artifices for self-preservation, self-elevation, and self-deliverance.
Nothing but new "Whys," nothing but new "Hows," no common formulas any
longer, misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other, decay,
deterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled, the
genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad,
a portentous simultaneousness of Spring and Autumn, full of new charms
and mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still inexhausted, still unwearied
corruption. Danger is again present, the mother of morality, great
danger; this time shifted into the individual, into the neighbour and
friend, into the street, into their own child, into their own heart,
into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and
volitions. What will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have
to preach? They discover, these sharp onlookers and loafers, that the
end is quickly approaching, that everything around them decays and
produces decay, that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow,
except one species of man, the incurably MEDIOCRE. The mediocre alone
have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselves--they will
be the men of the future, the sole survivors; "be like them! become
mediocre!" is now the only morality which has still a significance,
which still obtains a hearing.--But it is difficult to preach this
morality of mediocrity! it can never avow what it is and what it
desires! it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly
love--it will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY!

263. There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK, which more than anything else is
already the sign of a HIGH rank; there is a DELIGHT in the NUANCES
of reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and habits. The
refinement, goodness, and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test
when something passes by that is of the highest rank, but is not
yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touches and
incivilities: something that goes its way like a living touchstone,
undistinguished, undiscovered, and tentative, perhaps voluntarily veiled
and disguised. He whose task and practice it is to investigate souls,
will avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine the
ultimate value of a soul, the unalterable, innate order of rank to which
it belongs: he will test it by its INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE. DIFFERENCE
ENGENDRE HAINE: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly like
dirty water, when any holy vessel, any jewel from closed shrines, any
book bearing the marks of great destiny, is brought before it; while
on the other hand, there is an involuntary silence, a hesitation of the
eye, a cessation of all gestures, by which it is indicated that a soul
FEELS the nearness of what is worthiest of respect. The way in which, on
the whole, the reverence for the BIBLE has hitherto been maintained
in Europe, is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of
manners which Europe owes to Christianity: books of such profoundness
and supreme significance require for their protection an external
tyranny of authority, in order to acquire the PERIOD of thousands of
years which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them. Much has been
achieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the masses
(the shallow-pates and the boobies of every kind) that they are not
allowed to touch everything, that there are holy experiences before
which they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand--it
is almost their highest advance towards humanity. On the contrary, in
the so-called cultured classes, the believers in "modern ideas," nothing
is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame, the easy insolence of
eye and hand with which they touch, taste, and finger everything; and it
is possible that even yet there is more RELATIVE nobility of taste, and
more tact for reverence among the people, among the lower classes of
the people, especially among peasants, than among the newspaper-reading
DEMIMONDE of intellect, the cultured class.

264. It cannot be effaced from a man's soul what his ancestors have
preferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps diligent
economizers attached to a desk and a cash-box, modest and citizen-like
in their desires, modest also in their virtues; or whether they were
accustomed to commanding from morning till night, fond of rude pleasures
and probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities; or whether,
finally, at one time or another, they have sacrificed old privileges of
birth and possession, in order to live wholly for their faith--for their
"God,"--as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience, which blushes
at every compromise. It is quite impossible for a man NOT to have
the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his
constitution, whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary. This is
the problem of race. Granted that one knows something of the parents,
it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child: any kind
of offensive incontinence, any kind of sordid envy, or of clumsy
self-vaunting--the three things which together have constituted the
genuine plebeian type in all times--such must pass over to the child, as
surely as bad blood; and with the help of the best education and culture
one will only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredity.--And
what else does education and culture try to do nowadays! In our very
democratic, or rather, very plebeian age, "education" and "culture" MUST
be essentially the art of deceiving--deceiving with regard to origin,
with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul. An educator
who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else, and called out
constantly to his pupils: "Be true! Be natural! Show yourselves as you
are!"--even such a virtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short time
to have recourse to the FURCA of Horace, NATURAM EXPELLERE: with what
results? "Plebeianism" USQUE RECURRET. [FOOTNOTE: Horace's "Epistles,"
I. x. 24.]

265. At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I submit that egoism
belongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the unalterable belief
that to a being such as "we," other beings must naturally be in
subjection, and have to sacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts the
fact of his egoism without question, and also without consciousness of
harshness, constraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something
that may have its basis in the primary law of things:--if he sought a
designation for it he would say: "It is justice itself." He acknowledges
under certain circumstances, which made him hesitate at first, that
there are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled this
question of rank, he moves among those equals and equally privileged
ones with the same assurance, as regards modesty and delicate respect,
which he enjoys in intercourse with himself--in accordance with an
innate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand. It is an
ADDITIONAL instance of his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation
in intercourse with his equals--every star is a similar egoist; he
honours HIMSELF in them, and in the rights which he concedes to them, he
has no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights, as the ESSENCE of
all intercourse, belongs also to the natural condition of things. The
noble soul gives as he takes, prompted by the passionate and sensitive
instinct of requital, which is at the root of his nature. The notion of
"favour" has, INTER PARES, neither significance nor good repute; there
may be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one from
above, and of drinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for those
arts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude. His egoism hinders him
here: in general, he looks "aloft" unwillingly--he looks either FORWARD,
horizontally and deliberately, or downwards--HE KNOWS THAT HE IS ON A
HEIGHT.

266. "One can only truly esteem him who does not LOOK OUT FOR
himself."--Goethe to Rath Schlosser.

267. The Chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their children:
"SIAO-SIN" ("MAKE THY HEART SMALL"). This is the essentially fundamental
tendency in latter-day civilizations. I have no doubt that an ancient
Greek, also, would first of all remark the self-dwarfing in us Europeans
of today--in this respect alone we should immediately be "distasteful"
to him.

268. What, after all, is ignobleness?--Words are vocal symbols for
ideas; ideas, however, are more or less definite mental symbols
for frequently returning and concurring sensations, for groups of
sensations. It is not sufficient to use the same words in order to
understand one another: we must also employ the same words for the same
kind of internal experiences, we must in the end have experiences IN
COMMON. On this account the people of one nation understand one another
better than those belonging to different nations, even when they use
the same language; or rather, when people have lived long together under
similar conditions (of climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there
ORIGINATES therefrom an entity that "understands itself"--namely, a
nation. In all souls a like number of frequently recurring experiences
have gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely: about
these matters people understand one another rapidly and always more
rapidly--the history of language is the history of a process of
abbreviation; on the basis of this quick comprehension people always
unite closer and closer. The greater the danger, the greater is the
need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary; not to
misunderstand one another in danger--that is what cannot at all be
dispensed with in intercourse. Also in all loves and friendships one has
the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery
has been made that in using the same words, one of the two parties has
feelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears different from those of
the other. (The fear of the "eternal misunderstanding": that is the good
genius which so often keeps persons of different sexes from too
hasty attachments, to which sense and heart prompt them--and NOT some
Schopenhauerian "genius of the species"!) Whichever groups of sensations
within a soul awaken most readily, begin to speak, and give the word of
command--these decide as to the general order of rank of its values, and
determine ultimately its list of desirable things. A man's estimates of
value betray something of the STRUCTURE of his soul, and wherein it
sees its conditions of life, its intrinsic needs. Supposing now that
necessity has from all time drawn together only such men as could
express similar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbols,
it results on the whole that the easy COMMUNICABILITY of need,
which implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and COMMON
experiences, must have been the most potent of all the forces which
have hitherto operated upon mankind. The more similar, the more ordinary
people, have always had and are still having the advantage; the more
select, more refined, more unique, and difficultly comprehensible, are
liable to stand alone; they succumb to accidents in their isolation, and
seldom propagate themselves. One must appeal to immense opposing forces,
in order to thwart this natural, all-too-natural PROGRESSUS IN SIMILE,
the evolution of man to the similar, the ordinary, the average, the
gregarious--to the IGNOBLE--!

269. The more a psychologist--a born, an unavoidable psychologist
and soul-diviner--turns his attention to the more select cases and
individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy:
he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. For
the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually
constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a
rule always before one's eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologist
who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then
discovers ALMOST repeatedly throughout all history, this universal
inner "desperateness" of higher men, this eternal "too late!" in every
sense--may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with
bitterness against his own lot, and of his making an attempt at
self-destruction--of his "going to ruin" himself. One may perceive
in almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful
intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby
disclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort
of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and
incisiveness--from what his "business"--has laid upon his conscience.
The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is easily silenced by the
judgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour,
admire, love, and glorify, where he has PERCEIVED--or he even conceals
his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. Perhaps
the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that, precisely
where he has learnt GREAT SYMPATHY, together with great CONTEMPT, the
multitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt
great reverence--reverence for "great men" and marvelous animals, for
the sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland, the earth, the
dignity of mankind, and one's own self, to whom one points the young,
and in view of whom one educates them. And who knows but in all great
instances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshipped
a God, and that the "God" was only a poor sacrificial animal! SUCCESS
has always been the greatest liar--and the "work" itself is a success;
the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in
their creations until they are unrecognizable; the "work" of the artist,
of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, is REPUTED
to have created it; the "great men," as they are reverenced, are poor
little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical values
spurious coinage PREVAILS. Those great poets, for example, such as
Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol (I do not venture to mention
much greater names, but I have them in my mind), as they now appear, and
were perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous,
and childish, light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust;
with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking
revenge with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking
forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in
the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the
Will-o'-the-Wisps around the swamps, and PRETEND TO BE stars--the people
then call them idealists,--often struggling with protracted disgust,
with an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief, which makes them cold,
and obliges them to languish for GLORIA and devour "faith as it is"
out of the hands of intoxicated adulators:--what a TORMENT these great
artists are and the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once
found them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from woman--who
is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also unfortunately eager
to help and save to an extent far beyond her powers--that THEY have
learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted SYMPATHY, which
the multitude, above all the reverent multitude, do not understand,
and overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. This
sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman would
like to believe that love can do EVERYTHING--it is the SUPERSTITION
peculiar to her. Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor,
helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love
is--he finds that it rather DESTROYS than saves!--It is possible that
under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden
one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE:
the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that
never had enough of any human love, that DEMANDED love, that demanded
inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible
outbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poor
soul insatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send
thither those who WOULD NOT love him--and that at last, enlightened
about human love, had to invent a God who is entire love, entire
CAPACITY for love--who takes pity on human love, because it is so
paltry, so ignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such
KNOWLEDGE about love--SEEKS for death!--But why should one deal with
such painful matters? Provided, of course, that one is not obliged to do
so.

270. The intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who has
suffered deeply--it almost determines the order of rank HOW deeply men
can suffer--the chilling certainty, with which he is thoroughly imbued
and coloured, that by virtue of his suffering he KNOWS MORE than the
shrewdest and wisest can ever know, that he has been familiar with,
and "at home" in, many distant, dreadful worlds of which "YOU know
nothing"!--this silent intellectual haughtiness of the sufferer, this
pride of the elect of knowledge, of the "initiated," of the almost
sacrificed, finds all forms of disguise necessary to protect itself from
contact with officious and sympathizing hands, and in general from all
that is not its equal in suffering. Profound suffering makes noble:
it separates.--One of the most refined forms of disguise is Epicurism,
along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste, which takes
suffering lightly, and puts itself on the defensive against all that
is sorrowful and profound. They are "gay men" who make use of gaiety,
because they are misunderstood on account of it--they WISH to be
misunderstood. There are "scientific minds" who make use of science,
because it gives a gay appearance, and because scientificness leads to
the conclusion that a person is superficial--they WISH to mislead to a
false conclusion. There are free insolent minds which would fain conceal
and deny that they are broken, proud, incurable hearts (the cynicism of
Hamlet--the case of Galiani); and occasionally folly itself is the mask
of an unfortunate OVER-ASSURED knowledge.--From which it follows that it
is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence "for the mask,"
and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place.

271. That which separates two men most profoundly is a different sense
and grade of purity. What does it matter about all their honesty and
reciprocal usefulness, what does it matter about all their mutual
good-will: the fact still remains--they "cannot smell each other!" The
highest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the
most extraordinary and dangerous isolation, as a saint: for it is just
holiness--the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question. Any
kind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath,
any kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out
of night into the morning, and out of gloom, out of "affliction" into
clearness, brightness, depth, and refinement:--just as much as such a
tendency DISTINGUISHES--it is a noble tendency--it also SEPARATES.--The
pity of the saint is pity for the FILTH of the human, all-too-human.
And there are grades and heights where pity itself is regarded by him as
impurity, as filth.

272. Signs of nobility: never to think of lowering our duties to the
rank of duties for everybody; to be unwilling to renounce or to share
our responsibilities; to count our prerogatives, and the exercise of
them, among our DUTIES.

273. A man who strives after great things, looks upon every one whom
he encounters on his way either as a means of advance, or a delay and
hindrance--or as a temporary resting-place. His peculiar lofty BOUNTY
to his fellow-men is only possible when he attains his elevation and
dominates. Impatience, and the consciousness of being always condemned
to comedy up to that time--for even strife is a comedy, and conceals the
end, as every means does--spoil all intercourse for him; this kind of
man is acquainted with solitude, and what is most poisonous in it.

274. THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO WAIT.--Happy chances are necessary, and
many incalculable elements, in order that a higher man in whom the
solution of a problem is dormant, may yet take action, or "break forth,"
as one might say--at the right moment. On an average it DOES NOT happen;
and in all corners of the earth there are waiting ones sitting who
hardly know to what extent they are waiting, and still less that they
wait in vain. Occasionally, too, the waking call comes too late--the
chance which gives "permission" to take action--when their best youth,
and strength for action have been used up in sitting still; and how many
a one, just as he "sprang up," has found with horror that his limbs are
benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy! "It is too late," he has
said to himself--and has become self-distrustful and henceforth for ever
useless.--In the domain of genius, may not the "Raphael without
hands" (taking the expression in its widest sense) perhaps not be the
exception, but the rule?--Perhaps genius is by no means so rare: but
rather the five hundred HANDS which it requires in order to tyrannize
over the [GREEK INSERTED HERE], "the right time"--in order to take
chance by the forelock!

275. He who does not WISH to see the height of a man, looks all the
more sharply at what is low in him, and in the foreground--and thereby
betrays himself.

276. In all kinds of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is
better off than the nobler soul: the dangers of the latter must be
greater, the probability that it will come to grief and perish is in
fact immense, considering the multiplicity of the conditions of its
existence.--In a lizard a finger grows again which has been lost; not so
in man.--

277. It is too bad! Always the old story! When a man has finished
building his house, he finds that he has learnt unawares something
which he OUGHT absolutely to have known before he--began to build. The
eternal, fatal "Too late!" The melancholia of everything COMPLETED--!

278.--Wanderer, who art thou? I see thee follow thy path without scorn,
without love, with unfathomable eyes, wet and sad as a plummet which has
returned to the light insatiated out of every depth--what did it seek
down there?--with a bosom that never sighs, with lips that conceal their
loathing, with a hand which only slowly grasps: who art thou? what
hast thou done? Rest thee here: this place has hospitality for every
one--refresh thyself! And whoever thou art, what is it that now pleases
thee? What will serve to refresh thee? Only name it, whatever I have
I offer thee! "To refresh me? To refresh me? Oh, thou prying one,
what sayest thou! But give me, I pray thee---" What? what? Speak out!
"Another mask! A second mask!"

279. Men of profound sadness betray themselves when they are happy: they
have a mode of seizing upon happiness as though they would choke and
strangle it, out of jealousy--ah, they know only too well that it will
flee from them!

280. "Bad! Bad! What? Does he not--go back?" Yes! But you misunderstand
him when you complain about it. He goes back like every one who is about
to make a great spring.

281.--"Will people believe it of me? But I insist that they believe it
of me: I have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about
myself, only in very rare cases, only compulsorily, always without
delight in 'the subject,' ready to digress from 'myself,' and always
without faith in the result, owing to an unconquerable distrust of the
POSSIBILITY of self-knowledge, which has led me so far as to feel a
CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO even in the idea of 'direct knowledge' which
theorists allow themselves:--this matter of fact is almost the most
certain thing I know about myself. There must be a sort of repugnance
in me to BELIEVE anything definite about myself.--Is there perhaps
some enigma therein? Probably; but fortunately nothing for my own
teeth.--Perhaps it betrays the species to which I belong?--but not to
myself, as is sufficiently agreeable to me."

282.--"But what has happened to you?"--"I do not know," he said,
hesitatingly; "perhaps the Harpies have flown over my table."--It
sometimes happens nowadays that a gentle, sober, retiring man becomes
suddenly mad, breaks the plates, upsets the table, shrieks, raves,
and shocks everybody--and finally withdraws, ashamed, and raging at
himself--whither? for what purpose? To famish apart? To suffocate with
his memories?--To him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul,
and only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared, the danger
will always be great--nowadays, however, it is extraordinarily so.
Thrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age, with which he does
not like to eat out of the same dish, he may readily perish of hunger
and thirst--or, should he nevertheless finally "fall to," of sudden
nausea.--We have probably all sat at tables to which we did not belong;
and precisely the most spiritual of us, who are most difficult to
nourish, know the dangerous DYSPEPSIA which originates from a sudden
insight and disillusionment about our food and our messmates--the
AFTER-DINNER NAUSEA.

283. If one wishes to praise at all, it is a delicate and at the
same time a noble self-control, to praise only where one DOES NOT
agree--otherwise in fact one would praise oneself, which is contrary
to good taste:--a self-control, to be sure, which offers excellent
opportunity and provocation to constant MISUNDERSTANDING. To be able to
allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality, one must
not live among intellectual imbeciles, but rather among men whose
misunderstandings and mistakes amuse by their refinement--or one will
have to pay dearly for it!--"He praises me, THEREFORE he acknowledges me
to be right"--this asinine method of inference spoils half of the life
of us recluses, for it brings the asses into our neighbourhood and
friendship.

284. To live in a vast and proud tranquility; always beyond... To have,
or not to have, one's emotions, one's For and Against, according to
choice; to lower oneself to them for hours; to SEAT oneself on them as
upon horses, and often as upon asses:--for one must know how to make
use of their stupidity as well as of their fire. To conserve one's
three hundred foregrounds; also one's black spectacles: for there are
circumstances when nobody must look into our eyes, still less into our
"motives." And to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice,
politeness. And to remain master of one's four virtues, courage,
insight, sympathy, and solitude. For solitude is a virtue with us, as
a sublime bent and bias to purity, which divines that in the contact of
man and man--"in society"--it must be unavoidably impure. All society
makes one somehow, somewhere, or sometime--"commonplace."

285. The greatest events and thoughts--the greatest thoughts, however,
are the greatest events--are longest in being comprehended: the
generations which are contemporary with them do not EXPERIENCE such
events--they live past them. Something happens there as in the realm of
stars. The light of the furthest stars is longest in reaching man; and
before it has arrived man DENIES--that there are stars there. "How
many centuries does a mind require to be understood?"--that is also a
standard, one also makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewith,
such as is necessary for mind and for star.

286. "Here is the prospect free, the mind exalted." [FOOTNOTE: Goethe's
"Faust," Part II, Act V. The words of Dr. Marianus.]--But there is a
reverse kind of man, who is also upon a height, and has also a free
prospect--but looks DOWNWARDS.

287. What is noble? What does the word "noble" still mean for us
nowadays? How does the noble man betray himself, how is he recognized
under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism, by which
everything is rendered opaque and leaden?--It is not his actions which
establish his claim--actions are always ambiguous, always inscrutable;
neither is it his "works." One finds nowadays among artists and scholars
plenty of those who betray by their works that a profound longing for
nobleness impels them; but this very NEED of nobleness is radically
different from the needs of the noble soul itself, and is in fact the
eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof. It is not the works,
but the BELIEF which is here decisive and determines the order of
rank--to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper
meaning--it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about
itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and
perhaps, also, is not to be lost.--THE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR
ITSELF.--

288. There are men who are unavoidably intellectual, let them turn
and twist themselves as they will, and hold their hands before their
treacherous eyes--as though the hand were not a betrayer; it always
comes out at last that they have something which they hide--namely,
intellect. One of the subtlest means of deceiving, at least as long as
possible, and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider
than one really is--which in everyday life is often as desirable as
an umbrella,--is called ENTHUSIASM, including what belongs to it, for
instance, virtue. For as Galiani said, who was obliged to know it: VERTU
EST ENTHOUSIASME.

289. In the writings of a recluse one always hears something of the echo
of the wilderness, something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilance
of solitude; in his strongest words, even in his cry itself, there
sounds a new and more dangerous kind of silence, of concealment. He who
has sat day and night, from year's end to year's end, alone with his
soul in familiar discord and discourse, he who has become a cave-bear,
or a treasure-seeker, or a treasure-guardian and dragon in his cave--it
may be a labyrinth, but can also be a gold-mine--his ideas themselves
eventually acquire a twilight-colour of their own, and an odour, as much
of the depth as of the mould, something uncommunicative and repulsive,
which blows chilly upon every passer-by. The recluse does not believe
that a philosopher--supposing that a philosopher has always in the first
place been a recluse--ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions in
books: are not books written precisely to hide what is in us?--indeed,
he will doubt whether a philosopher CAN have "ultimate and actual"
opinions at all; whether behind every cave in him there is not, and must
necessarily be, a still deeper cave: an ampler, stranger, richer
world beyond the surface, an abyss behind every bottom, beneath every
"foundation." Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy--this is a
recluse's verdict: "There is something arbitrary in the fact that the
PHILOSOPHER came to a stand here, took a retrospect, and looked around;
that he HERE laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper--there
is also something suspicious in it." Every philosophy also CONCEALS a
philosophy; every opinion is also a LURKING-PLACE, every word is also a
MASK.

290. Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being
misunderstood. The latter perhaps wounds his vanity; but the former
wounds his heart, his sympathy, which always says: "Ah, why would you
also have as hard a time of it as I have?"

291. Man, a COMPLEX, mendacious, artful, and inscrutable animal, uncanny
to the other animals by his artifice and sagacity, rather than by his
strength, has invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his
soul as something SIMPLE; and the whole of morality is a long, audacious
falsification, by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of
the soul becomes possible. From this point of view there is perhaps much
more in the conception of "art" than is generally believed.

292. A philosopher: that is a man who constantly experiences, sees,
hears, suspects, hopes, and dreams extraordinary things; who is struck
by his own thoughts as if they came from the outside, from above and
below, as a species of events and lightning-flashes PECULIAR TO HIM; who
is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightnings; a portentous
man, around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and
something uncanny going on. A philosopher: alas, a being who often
runs away from himself, is often afraid of himself--but whose curiosity
always makes him "come to himself" again.

293. A man who says: "I like that, I take it for my own, and mean to
guard and protect it from every one"; a man who can conduct a case,
carry out a resolution, remain true to an opinion, keep hold of a woman,
punish and overthrow insolence; a man who has his indignation and his
sword, and to whom the weak, the suffering, the oppressed, and even the
animals willingly submit and naturally belong; in short, a man who is a
MASTER by nature--when such a man has sympathy, well! THAT sympathy has
value! But of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer! Or of
those even who preach sympathy! There is nowadays, throughout almost the
whole of Europe, a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain,
and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining, an effeminizing,
which, with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense, seeks
to deck itself out as something superior--there is a regular cult of
suffering. The UNMANLINESS of that which is called "sympathy" by such
groups of visionaries, is always, I believe, the first thing that
strikes the eye.--One must resolutely and radically taboo this latest
form of bad taste; and finally I wish people to put the good amulet,
"GAI SABER" ("gay science," in ordinary language), on heart and neck, as
a protection against it.

294. THE OLYMPIAN VICE.--Despite the philosopher who, as a genuine
Englishman, tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking
minds--"Laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature, which every
thinking mind will strive to overcome" (Hobbes),--I would even
allow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of their
laughing--up to those who are capable of GOLDEN laughter. And supposing
that Gods also philosophize, which I am strongly inclined to believe,
owing to many reasons--I have no doubt that they also know how to laugh
thereby in an overman-like and new fashion--and at the expense of all
serious things! Gods are fond of ridicule: it seems that they cannot
refrain from laughter even in holy matters.

295. The genius of the heart, as that great mysterious one possesses
it, the tempter-god and born rat-catcher of consciences, whose voice can
descend into the nether-world of every soul, who neither speaks a word
nor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch
of allurement, to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how to
appear,--not as he is, but in a guise which acts as an ADDITIONAL
constraint on his followers to press ever closer to him, to follow him
more cordially and thoroughly;--the genius of the heart, which imposes
silence and attention on everything loud and self-conceited, which
smoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longing--to lie placid
as a mirror, that the deep heavens may be reflected in them;--the genius
of the heart, which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate,
and to grasp more delicately; which scents the hidden and forgotten
treasure, the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark
ice, and is a divining-rod for every grain of gold, long buried and
imprisoned in mud and sand; the genius of the heart, from contact with
which every one goes away richer; not favoured or surprised, not as
though gratified and oppressed by the good things of others; but richer
in himself, newer than before, broken up, blown upon, and sounded by a
thawing wind; more uncertain, perhaps, more delicate, more fragile, more
bruised, but full of hopes which as yet lack names, full of a new will
and current, full of a new ill-will and counter-current... but what am I
doing, my friends? Of whom am I talking to you? Have I forgotten myself
so far that I have not even told you his name? Unless it be that you
have already divined of your own accord who this questionable God
and spirit is, that wishes to be PRAISED in such a manner? For, as it
happens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on his
legs, and in foreign lands, I have also encountered on my path many
strange and dangerous spirits; above all, however, and again and again,
the one of whom I have just spoken: in fact, no less a personage than
the God DIONYSUS, the great equivocator and tempter, to whom, as you
know, I once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first-fruits--the
last, as it seems to me, who has offered a SACRIFICE to him, for I
have found no one who could understand what I was then doing. In
the meantime, however, I have learned much, far too much, about the
philosophy of this God, and, as I said, from mouth to mouth--I, the last
disciple and initiate of the God Dionysus: and perhaps I might at last
begin to give you, my friends, as far as I am allowed, a little taste of
this philosophy? In a hushed voice, as is but seemly: for it has to do
with much that is secret, new, strange, wonderful, and uncanny. The
very fact that Dionysus is a philosopher, and that therefore Gods also
philosophize, seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring, and might
perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers;--among you, my
friends, there is less to be said against it, except that it comes too
late and not at the right time; for, as it has been disclosed to me, you
are loth nowadays to believe in God and gods. It may happen, too, that
in the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the
strict usages of your ears? Certainly the God in question went further,
very much further, in such dialogues, and was always many paces ahead of
me... Indeed, if it were allowed, I should have to give him, according
to human usage, fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit, I should
have to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless
honesty, truthfulness, and love of wisdom. But such a God does not know
what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp. "Keep that," he
would say, "for thyself and those like thee, and whoever else require
it! I--have no reason to cover my nakedness!" One suspects that this
kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame?--He once said:
"Under certain circumstances I love mankind"--and referred thereby to
Ariadne, who was present; "in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave,
inventive animal, that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his way
even through all labyrinths. I like man, and often think how I can
still further advance him, and make him stronger, more evil, and more
profound."--"Stronger, more evil, and more profound?" I asked in horror.
"Yes," he said again, "stronger, more evil, and more profound; also more
beautiful"--and thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile,
as though he had just paid some charming compliment. One here sees at
once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks;--and in general
there are good grounds for supposing that in some things the Gods could
all of them come to us men for instruction. We men are--more human.--

296. Alas! what are you, after all, my written and painted thoughts! Not
long ago you were so variegated, young and malicious, so full of thorns
and secret spices, that you made me sneeze and laugh--and now? You
have already doffed your novelty, and some of you, I fear, are ready
to become truths, so immortal do they look, so pathetically honest, so
tedious! And was it ever otherwise? What then do we write and paint,
we mandarins with Chinese brush, we immortalisers of things which LEND
themselves to writing, what are we alone capable of painting? Alas, only
that which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour! Alas,
only exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow sentiments! Alas,
only birds strayed and fatigued by flight, which now let themselves be
captured with the hand--with OUR hand! We immortalize what cannot live
and fly much longer, things only which are exhausted and mellow! And it
is only for your AFTERNOON, you, my written and painted thoughts, for
which alone I have colours, many colours, perhaps, many variegated
softenings, and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds;--but
nobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning, you sudden
sparks and marvels of my solitude, you, my old, beloved--EVIL thoughts!




FROM THE HEIGHTS

By F W Nietzsche

Translated by L. A. Magnus


                       1.

     MIDDAY of Life! Oh, season of delight!
                      My summer's park!
     Uneaseful joy to look, to lurk, to hark--
     I peer for friends, am ready day and night,--
     Where linger ye, my friends? The time is right!

                       2.

     Is not the glacier's grey today for you
                         Rose-garlanded?
     The brooklet seeks you, wind, cloud, with longing thread
     And thrust themselves yet higher to the blue,
     To spy for you from farthest eagle's view.

                       3.

     My table was spread out for you on high--
                      Who dwelleth so
     Star-near, so near the grisly pit below?--
     My realm--what realm hath wider boundary?
     My honey--who hath sipped its fragrancy?

                       4.

     Friends, ye are there! Woe me,--yet I am not
                        He whom ye seek?
     Ye stare and stop--better your wrath could speak!
     I am not I? Hand, gait, face, changed? And what
     I am, to you my friends, now am I not?

                       5.

     Am I an other? Strange am I to Me?
                      Yet from Me sprung?
     A wrestler, by himself too oft self-wrung?
     Hindering too oft my own self's potency,
     Wounded and hampered by self-victory?

                       6.

     I sought where-so the wind blows keenest. There
                     I learned to dwell
     Where no man dwells, on lonesome ice-lorn fell,
     And unlearned Man and God and curse and prayer?
     Became a ghost haunting the glaciers bare?

                       7.

     Ye, my old friends! Look! Ye turn pale, filled o'er
                      With love and fear!
     Go! Yet not in wrath. Ye could ne'er live here.
     Here in the farthest realm of ice and scaur,
     A huntsman must one be, like chamois soar.

                       8.

     An evil huntsman was I? See how taut
                    My bow was bent!
     Strongest was he by whom such bolt were sent--
     Woe now! That arrow is with peril fraught,
     Perilous as none.--Have yon safe home ye sought!

                       9.

     Ye go! Thou didst endure enough, oh, heart;--
                     Strong was thy hope;
     Unto new friends thy portals widely ope,
     Let old ones be. Bid memory depart!
     Wast thou young then, now--better young thou art!

                       10.

     What linked us once together, one hope's tie--
                    (Who now doth con
     Those lines, now fading, Love once wrote thereon?)--
     Is like a parchment, which the hand is shy
     To touch--like crackling leaves, all seared, all dry.

                       11.

     Oh! Friends no more! They are--what name for those?--
                           Friends' phantom-flight
     Knocking at my heart's window-pane at night,
     Gazing on me, that speaks "We were" and goes,--
     Oh, withered words, once fragrant as the rose!

                       12.

     Pinings of youth that might not understand!
                       For which I pined,
     Which I deemed changed with me, kin of my kind:
     But they grew old, and thus were doomed and banned:
     None but new kith are native of my land!

                       13.

     Midday of life! My second youth's delight!
                       My summer's park!
     Unrestful joy to long, to lurk, to hark!
     I peer for friends!--am ready day and night,
     For my new friends. Come! Come! The time is right!

                       14.

     This song is done,--the sweet sad cry of rue
                       Sang out its end;
     A wizard wrought it, he the timely friend,
     The midday-friend,--no, do not ask me who;
     At midday 'twas, when one became as two.

                       15.

     We keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our bourne,
                      Our aims self-same:
     The Guest of Guests, friend Zarathustra, came!
     The world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn,
     And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn.﻿1.

We are unknown, we knowers, ourselves to ourselves: this has its own
good reason. We have never searched for ourselves--how should it then
come to pass, that we should ever _find_ ourselves? Rightly has it been
said: "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." _Our_
treasure is there, where stand the hives of our knowledge. It is to
those hives that we are always striving; as born creatures of flight,
and as the honey-gatherers of the spirit, we care really in our hearts
only for one thing--to bring something "home to the hive!"

As far as the rest of life with its so-called "experiences" is
concerned, which of us has even sufficient serious interest? or
sufficient time? In our dealings with such points of life, we are, I
fear, never properly to the point; to be precise, our heart is not
there, and certainly not our ear. Rather like one who, delighting
in a divine distraction, or sunken in the seas of his own soul, in
whose ear the clock has just thundered with all its force its twelve
strokes of noon, suddenly wakes up, and asks himself, "What has in
point of fact just struck?" so do we at times rub afterwards, as it
were, our puzzled ears, and ask in complete astonishment and complete
embarrassment, "Through what have we in point of fact just lived?"
further, "Who are we in point of fact?" and count, _after they have
struck_, as I have explained, all the twelve throbbing beats of the
clock of our experience, of our life, of our being--ah!--and count
wrong in the endeavour. Of necessity we remain strangers to ourselves,
we understand ourselves not, in ourselves we are bound to be mistaken,
for of us holds good to all eternity the motto, "Each one is the
farthest away from himself"--as far as ourselves are concerned we are
not "knowers."

My thoughts concerning the _genealogy_ of our moral prejudices--for
they constitute the issue in this polemic--have their first, bald,
and provisional expression in that collection of aphorisms entitled
_Human, all-too-Human, a Book for Free Minds_, the writing of which
was begun in Sorrento, during a winter which allowed me to gaze over
the broad and dangerous territory through which my mind had up to that
time wandered. This took place in the winter of 1876-77; the thoughts
themselves are older. They were in their substance already the same
thoughts which I take up again in the following treatises:--we hope
that they have derived benefit from the long interval, that they have
grown riper, clearer, stronger, more complete. The fact, however,
that I still cling to them even now, that in the meanwhile they have
always held faster by each other, have, in fact, grown out of their
original shape and into each other, all this strengthens in my mind the
joyous confidence that they must have been originally neither separate
disconnected capricious nor sporadic phenomena, but have sprung from
a common root, from a fundamental "_fiat_" of knowledge, whose empire
reached to the soul's depth, and that ever grew more definite in its
voice, and more definite in its demands. That is the only state of
affairs that is proper in the case of a philosopher.

We have no right to be "_disconnected_"; we must neither err
"disconnectedly" nor strike the truth "disconnectedly." Rather with
the necessity with which a tree bears its fruit, so do our thoughts,
our values, our Yes's and No's and If's and Whether's, grow connected
and interrelated, mutual witnesses of _one_ will, _one_ health, _one_
kingdom, _one_ sun--as to whether they are to _your_ taste, these
fruits of ours?--But what matters that to the trees? What matters that
to us, us the philosophers?

Owing to a scrupulosity peculiar to myself, which I confess
reluctantly,--it concerns indeed _morality_,--a scrupulosity, which
manifests itself in my life at such an early period, with so much
spontaneity, with so chronic a persistence and so keen an opposition
to environment, epoch, precedent, and ancestry that I should have
been almost entitled to style it my "_â priori_"--my curiosity and my
suspicion felt themselves betimes bound to halt at the question, of
what in point of actual fact was the _origin_ of our "Good" and of
our "Evil." Indeed, at the boyish age of thirteen the problem of the
origin of Evil already haunted me: at an age "when games and God divide
one's heart," I devoted to that problem my first childish attempt
at the literary game, my first philosophic essay--and as regards my
infantile solution of the problem, well, I gave quite properly the
honour to God, and made him the _father_ of evil. Did my own "_â
priori_" demand that precise solution from me? that new, immoral, or
at least "amoral" "_â priori_" and that "categorical imperative" which
was its voice (but oh! how hostile to the Kantian article, and how
pregnant with problems!), to which since then I have given more and
more attention, and indeed what is more than attention. Fortunately
I soon learned to separate theological from moral prejudices, and
I gave up looking for a _supernatural_ origin of evil. A certain
amount of historical and philological education, to say nothing of
an innate faculty of psychological discrimination _par excellence_
succeeded in transforming almost immediately my original problem into
the following one:--Under what conditions did Man invent for himself
those judgments of values, "Good" and "Evil"? _And what intrinsic value
do they possess in themselves?_ Have they up to the present hindered
or advanced human well-being? Are they a symptom of the distress,
impoverishment, and degeneration of Human Life? Or, conversely, is
it in them that is manifested the fulness, the strength, and the
will of Life, its courage, its self-confidence, its future? On this
point I found and hazarded in my mind the most diverse answers, I
established distinctions in periods, peoples, and castes, I became a
specialist in my problem, and from my answers grew new questions, new
investigations, new conjectures, new probabilities; until at last I had
a land of my own and a soil of my own, a whole secret world growing and
flowering, like hidden gardens of whose existence no one could have an
inkling--oh, how happy are we, we finders of knowledge, provided that
we know how to keep silent sufficiently long.

My first impulse to publish some of my hypotheses concerning the origin
of morality I owe to a clear, well-written, and even precocious little
book, in which a perverse and vicious kind of moral philosophy (your
real English kind) was definitely presented to me for the first time;
and this attracted me--with that magnetic attraction, inherent in that
which is diametrically opposed and antithetical to one's own ideas.
The title of the book was _The Origin of the Moral Emotions_; its
author, Dr. Paul Rée; the year of its appearance, 1877. I may almost
say that I have never read anything in which every single dogma and
conclusion has called forth from me so emphatic a negation as did that
book; albeit a negation tainted by either pique or intolerance. I
referred accordingly both in season and out of season in the previous
works, at which I was then working, to the arguments of that book, not
to refute them--for what have I got to do with mere refutations but
substituting, as is natural to a positive mind, for an improbable
theory one which is more probable, and occasionally no doubt, for one
philosophic error, another. In that early period I gave, as I have
said, the first public expression to those theories of origin to which
these essays are devoted, but with a clumsiness which I was the last
to conceal from myself, for I was as yet cramped, being still without
a special language for these special subjects, still frequently liable
to relapse and to vacillation. To go into details, compare what I say
in _Human, all-too-Human_, part i., about the parallel early history
of Good and Evil, Aph. 45 (namely, their origin from the castes of the
aristocrats and the slaves); similarly, Aph. 136 et seq., concerning
the birth and value of ascetic morality; similarly, Aphs. 96, 99,
vol. ii., Aph. 89, concerning the Morality of Custom, that far older
and more original kind of morality which is _toto cœlo_ different
from the altruistic ethics (in which Dr. Rée, like all the English
moral philosophers, sees the ethical "Thing-in-itself"); finally,
Aph. 92. Similarly, Aph. 26 in _Human, all-too-Human_, part ii., and
Aph. 112, the _Dawn of Day_, concerning the origin of Justice as a
balance between persons of approximately equal power (equilibrium as
the hypothesis of all contract, consequently of all law); similarly,
concerning the origin of Punishment, _Human, all-too-Human_, part
ii., Aphs. 22, 23, in regard to which the deterrent object is neither
essential nor original (as Dr. Rée thinks:--rather is it that this
object is only imported, under certain definite conditions, and always
as something extra and additional).


5.

In reality I had set my heart at that time on something much more
important than the nature of the theories of myself or others
concerning the origin of morality (or, more precisely, the real
function from my view of these theories was to point an end to which
they were one among many means). The issue for me was the value
of morality, and on that subject I had to place myself in a state
of abstraction, in which I was almost alone with my great teacher
Schopenhauer, to whom that book, with all its passion and inherent
contradiction (for that book also was a polemic), turned for present
help as though he were still alive. The issue was, strangely enough,
the value of the "un-egoistic" instincts, the instincts of pity,
self-denial, and self-sacrifice which Schopenhauer had so persistently
painted in golden colours, deified and etherealised, that eventually
they appeared to him, as it were, high and dry, as "intrinsic values
in themselves," on the strength of which he uttered both to Life
and to himself his own negation. But against _these very_ instincts
there voiced itself in my soul a more and more fundamental mistrust, a
scepticism that dug ever deeper and deeper: and in this very instinct
I saw the _great_ danger of mankind, its most sublime temptation and
seduction--seduction to what? to nothingness?--in these very instincts
I saw the beginning of the end, stability, the exhaustion that gazes
backwards, the will turning _against_ Life, the last illness announcing
itself with its own mincing melancholy: I realised that the morality
of pity which spread wider and wider, and whose grip infected even
philosophers with its disease, was the most sinister symptom of our
modern European civilisation; I realised that it was the route along
which that civilisation slid on its way to--a new Buddhism?--a European
Buddhism?--_Nihilism_? This exaggerated estimation in which modern
philosophers have held pity, is quite a new phenomenon: up to that time
philosophers were absolutely unanimous as to the worthlessness of pity.
I need only mention Plato, Spinoza, La Rochefoucauld, and Kant--four
minds as mutually different as is possible, but united on one point;
their contempt of pity.


6.

This problem of the value of pity and of the pity-morality (I am an
opponent of the modern infamous emasculation of our emotions) seems at
the first blush a mere isolated problem, a note of interrogation for
itself; he, however, who once halts at this problem, and learns how to
put questions, will experience what I experienced:--a new and immense
vista unfolds itself before him, a sense of potentiality seizes him
like a vertigo, every species of doubt, mistrust, and fear springs
up, the belief in morality, nay, in all morality, totters,--finally a
new demand voices itself. Let us speak out this _new demand_: we need
a _critique_ of moral values, _the value of these values_ is for the
first time to be called into question--and for this purpose a knowledge
is necessary of the conditions and circumstances out of which these
values grew, and under which they experienced their evolution and
their distortion (morality as a result, as a symptom, as a mask, as
Tartuffism, as disease, as a misunderstanding; but also morality as a
cause, as a remedy, as a stimulant, as a fetter, as a drug), especially
as such a knowledge has neither existed up to the present time nor is
even now generally desired. The value of these "values" was taken for
granted as an indisputable fact, which was beyond all question. No one
has, up to the present, exhibited the faintest doubt or hesitation in
judging the "good man" to be of a higher value than the "evil man," of
a higher value with regard specifically to human progress, utility,
and prosperity generally, not forgetting the future. What? Suppose the
converse were the truth! What? Suppose there lurked in the "good man"
a symptom of retrogression, such as a danger, a temptation, a poison,
a _narcotic_, by means of which the present _battened on the future_!
More comfortable and less risky perhaps than its opposite, but also
pettier, meaner! So that morality would really be saddled with the
guilt, if the _maximum potentiality of the power and splendour_ of the
human species were never to be attained? So that really morality would
be the danger of dangers?


7.

Enough, that after this vista had disclosed itself to me, I myself had
reason to search for learned, bold, and industrious colleagues (I am
doing it even to this very day). It means traversing with new clamorous
questions, and at the same time with new eyes, the immense, distant,
and completely unexplored land of morality--of a morality which has
actually existed and been actually lived! and is this not practically
equivalent to first _discovering_ that land? If, in this context, I
thought, amongst others, of the aforesaid Dr. Rée, I did so because I
had no doubt that from the very nature of his questions he would be
compelled to have recourse to a truer method, in order to obtain his
answers. Have I deceived myself on that score? I wished at all events
to give a better direction of vision to an eye of such keenness, and
such impartiality. I wished to direct him to the real _history of
morality_, and to warn him, while there was yet time, against a world
of English theories that culminated in _the blue vacuum of heaven_.
Other colours, of course, rise immediately to one's mind as being a
hundred times more potent than blue for a genealogy of morals:--for
instance, grey, by which I mean authentic facts capable of definite
proof and having actually existed, or, to put it shortly, the whole
of that long hieroglyphic script (which is so hard to decipher) about
the past history of human morals. This script was unknown to Dr. Rée;
but he had read Darwin:--and so in his philosophy the Darwinian beast
and that pink of modernity, the demure weakling and dilettante, who
"bites no longer," shake hands politely in a fashion that is at least
instructive, the latter exhibiting a certain facial expression of
refined and good-humoured indolence, tinged with a touch of pessimism
and exhaustion; as if it really did not pay to take all these things--I
mean moral problems--so seriously. I, on the other hand, think that
there are no subjects which pay better for being taken seriously; part
of this payment is, that perhaps eventually they admit of being taken
gaily. This gaiety indeed, or, to use my own language, this joyful
wisdom, is a payment; a payment for a protracted, brave, laborious, and
burrowing seriousness, which, it goes without saying, is the attribute
of but a few. But on that day on which we say from the fullness of our
hearts, "Forward! our old morality too is fit material for Comedy,"
we shall have discovered a new plot, and a new possibility for the
Dionysian drama entitled The Soul's Fate--and he will speedily utilise
it, one can wager safely, he, the great ancient eternal dramatist of
the comedy of our existence.

If this writing be obscure to any individual, and jar on his ears, I
do not think that it is necessarily I who am to blame. It is clear
enough, on the hypothesis which I presuppose, namely, that the reader
has first read my previous writings and has not grudged them a certain
amount of trouble: it is not, indeed, a simple matter to get really at
their essence. Take, for instance, my _Zarathustra_; I allow no one
to pass muster as knowing that book, unless every single word therein
has at some time wrought in him a profound wound, and at some time
exercised on him a profound enchantment: then and not till then can he
enjoy the privilege of participating reverently in the halcyon element,
from which that work is born, in its sunny brilliance, its distance,
its spaciousness, its certainty. In other cases the aphoristic form
produces difficulty, but this is only because this form is treated
_too casually_. An aphorism properly coined and cast into its final
mould is far from being "deciphered" as soon as it has been read; on
the contrary, it is then that it first requires _to be expounded_--of
course for that purpose an art of exposition is necessary. The third
essay in this book provides an example of what is offered, of what in
such cases I call exposition: an aphorism is prefixed to that essay,
the essay itself is its commentary. Certainly one _quality_ which
nowadays has been best forgotten--and that is why it will take some
time yet for my writings to become readable--is essential in order
to practise reading as an art--a quality for the exercise of which it
is necessary to be a cow, and under no circumstances a modern man!--
rumination.

FIRST ESSAY. "GOOD AND EVIL," "GOOD AND BAD."


1.

Those English psychologists, who up to the present are the only
philosophers who are to be thanked for any endeavour to get as far
as a history of the origin of morality--these men, I say, offer us
in their own personalities no paltry problem;--they even have, if I
am to be quite frank about it, in their capacity of living riddles,
an advantage over their books--_they themselves are interesting!_
These English psychologists--what do they really mean? We always
find them voluntarily or involuntarily at the same task of pushing
to the front the _partie honteuse_ of our inner world, and looking
for the efficient, governing, and decisive principle in that precise
quarter where the intellectual self-respect of the race would be
the most reluctant to find it (for example, in the _vis inertiæ_ of
habit, or in forgetfulness, or in a blind and fortuitous mechanism
and association of ideas, or in some factor that is purely passive,
reflex, molecular, or fundamentally stupid)--what is the real motive
power which always impels these psychologists in precisely _this_
direction? Is it an instinct for human disparagement somewhat sinister,
vulgar, and malignant, or perhaps incomprehensible even to itself? or
perhaps a touch of pessimistic jealousy, the mistrust of disillusioned
idealists who have become gloomy, poisoned, and bitter? or a petty
subconscious enmity and rancour against Christianity (and Plato), that
has conceivably never crossed the threshold of consciousness? or just a
vicious taste for those elements of life which are bizarre, painfully
paradoxical, mystical, and illogical? or, as a final alternative, a
dash of each of these motives--a little vulgarity, a little gloominess,
a little anti-Christianity, a little craving for the necessary piquancy?

But I am told that it is simply a case of old frigid and tedious frogs
crawling and hopping around men and inside men, as if they were as
thoroughly at home there, as they would be in a _swamp_.

I am opposed to this statement, nay, I do not believe it; and if, in
the impossibility of knowledge, one is permitted to wish, so do I wish
from my heart that just the converse metaphor should apply, and that
these analysts with their psychological microscopes should be, at
bottom, brave, proud, and magnanimous animals who know how to bridle
both their hearts and their smarts, and have specifically trained
themselves to sacrifice what is desirable to what is true, any truth
in fact, even the simple, bitter, ugly, repulsive, unchristian, and
immoral truths--for there are truths of that description.


2.

All honour, then, to the noble spirits who would fain dominate these
historians of morality. But it is certainly a pity that they lack the
_historical sense_ itself, that they themselves are quite deserted
by all the beneficent spirits of history. The whole train of their
thought runs, as was always the way of old-fashioned philosophers, on
thoroughly unhistorical lines: there is no doubt on this point. The
crass ineptitude of their genealogy of morals is immediately apparent
when the question arises of ascertaining the origin of the idea and
judgment of "good." "Man had originally," so speaks their decree,
"praised and called 'good' altruistic acts from the standpoint of
those on whom they were conferred, that is, those to whom they were
_useful_; subsequently the origin of this praise was _forgotten_, and
altruistic acts, simply because, as a sheer matter of habit, they were
praised as good, came also to be felt as good--as though they contained
in themselves some intrinsic goodness." The thing is obvious:--this
initial derivation contains already all the typical and idiosyncratic
traits of the English psychologists--we have "utility," "forgetting,"
"habit," and finally "error," the whole assemblage forming the basis
of a system of values, on which the higher man has up to the present
prided himself as though it were a kind of privilege of man in general.
This pride _must_ be brought low, this system of values _must_ lose its
values: is that attained?

Now the first argument that comes ready to my hand is that the real
homestead of the concept "good" is sought and located in the wrong
place: the judgment "good" did not originate among those to whom
goodness was shown. Much rather has it been the good themselves,
that is, the aristocratic, the powerful, the high-stationed, the
high-minded, who have felt that they themselves were good, and that
their actions were good, that is to say of the first order, in
contradistinction to all the low, the low-minded, the vulgar, and
the plebeian. It was out of this pathos of distance that they first
arrogated the right to create values for their own profit, and to
coin the names of such values: what had they to do with utility? The
standpoint of utility is as alien and as inapplicable as it could
possibly be, when we have to deal with so volcanic an effervescence of
supreme values, creating and demarcating as they do a hierarchy within
themselves: it is at this juncture that one arrives at an appreciation
of the contrast to that tepid temperature, which is the presupposition
on which every combination of worldly wisdom and every calculation of
practical expediency is always based--and not for one occasional, not
for one exceptional instance, but chronically. The pathos of nobility
and distance, as I have said, the chronic and despotic _esprit de
corps_ and fundamental instinct of a higher dominant race coming into
association with a meaner race, an "under race," this is the origin of
the antithesis of good and bad.

(The masters' right of giving names goes so far that it is permissible
to look upon language itself as the expression of the power of the
masters: they say "this _is_ that, and that," they seal finally every
object and every event with a sound, and thereby at the same time take
possession of it.) It is because of this origin that the word "good"
is far from having any necessary connection with altruistic acts, in
accordance with the superstitious belief of these moral philosophers.
On the contrary, it is on the occasion of the _decay_ of aristocratic
values, that the antitheses between "egoistic" and "altruistic"
presses more and more heavily on the human conscience--it is, to use
my own language, the _herd instinct_ which finds in this antithesis an
expression in many ways. And even then it takes a considerable time
for this instinct to become sufficiently dominant, for the valuation
to be inextricably dependent on this antithesis (as is the case in
contemporary Europe); for to-day that prejudice is predominant, which,
acting even now with all the intensity of an obsession and brain
disease, holds that "moral," "altruistic," and "_désintéressé_" are
concepts of equal value.


3.

In the second place, quite apart from the fact that this hypothesis as
to the genesis of the value "good" cannot be historically upheld, it
suffers from an inherent psychological contradiction. The utility of
altruistic conduct has presumably been the origin of its being praised,
and this origin has become _forgotten_:--But in what conceivable way is
this forgetting _possible_! Has perchance the utility of such conduct
ceased at some given moment? The contrary is the case. This utility has
rather been experienced every day at all times, and is consequently
a feature that obtains a new and regular emphasis with every fresh
day; it follows that, so far from vanishing from the consciousness, so
far indeed from being forgotten, it must necessarily become impressed
on the consciousness with ever-increasing distinctness. How much
more logical is that contrary theory (it is not the truer for that)
which is represented, for instance, by Herbert Spencer, who places
the concept "good" as essentially similar to the concept "useful,"
"purposive," so that in the judgments "good" and "bad" mankind is
simply summarising and investing with a sanction its _unforgotten_ and
_unforgettable_ experiences concerning the "useful-purposive" and the
"mischievous-non-purposive." According to this theory, "good" is the
attribute of that which has previously shown itself useful; and so
is able to claim to be considered "valuable in the highest degree,"
"valuable in itself." This method of explanation is also, as I have
said, wrong, but at any rate the explanation itself is coherent, and
psychologically tenable.


4.

The guide-post which first put me on the right track was this
question--what is the true etymological significance of the various
symbols for the idea "good" which have been coined in the various
languages? I then found that they all led back to _the same evolution
of the same idea_--that everywhere "aristocrat," "noble" (in the
social sense), is the root idea, out of which have necessarily
developed "good" in the sense of "with aristocratic soul," "noble,"
in the sense of "with a soul of high calibre," "with a privileged
soul"--a development which invariably runs parallel with that other
evolution by which "vulgar," "plebeian," "low," are made to change
finally into "bad." The most eloquent proof of this last contention
is the German word "_schlecht_" itself: this word is identical with
"_schlicht_"--(compare "_schlechtweg_" and "_schlechterdings_")--which,
originally and as yet without any sinister innuendo, simply denoted
the plebeian man in contrast to the aristocratic man. It is at the
sufficiently late period of the Thirty Years' War that this sense
becomes changed to the sense now current. From the standpoint of
the Genealogy of Morals this discovery seems to be substantial: the
lateness of it is to be attributed to the retarding influence exercised
in the modern world by democratic prejudice in the sphere of all
questions of origin. This extends, as will shortly be shown, even to
the province of natural science and physiology, which, _prima facie_
is the most objective. The extent of the mischief which is caused by
this prejudice (once it is free of all trammels except those of its own
malice), particularly to Ethics and History, is shown by the notorious
case of Buckle: it was in Buckle that that _plebeianism_ of the modern
spirit, which is of English origin, broke out once again from its
malignant soil with all the violence of a slimy volcano, and with that
salted, rampant, and vulgar eloquence with which up to the present time
all volcanoes have spoken.


5.

With regard to our problem, which can justly be called an intimate
problem, and which elects to appeal to only a limited number of ears:
it is of no small interest to ascertain that in those words and roots
which denote "good" we catch glimpses of that arch-trait, on the
strength of which the aristocrats feel themselves to be beings of
a higher order than their fellows. Indeed, they call themselves in
perhaps the most frequent instances simply after their superiority
in power (_e.g._ "the powerful," "the lords," "the commanders"), or
after the most obvious sign of their superiority, as for example
"the rich," "the possessors" (that is the meaning of _arya_; and the
Iranian and Slav languages correspond). But they also call themselves
after some _characteristic idiosyncrasy_; and this is the case which
now concerns us. They name themselves, for instance, "the truthful":
this is first done by the Greek nobility whose mouthpiece is found in
Theognis, the Megarian poet. The word ἐσθλος, which is coined for the
purpose, signifies etymologically "one who _is_," who has reality, who
is real, who is true; and then with a subjective twist, the "true,"
as the "truthful": at this stage in the evolution of the idea, it
becomes the motto and party cry of the nobility, and quite completes
the transition to the meaning "noble," so as to place outside the pale
the lying, vulgar man, as Theognis conceives and portrays him--till
finally the word after the decay of the nobility is left to delineate
psychological _noblesse_, and becomes as it were ripe and mellow. In
the word κακός as in δειλός (the plebeian in contrast to the ἀγαθός)
the cowardice is emphasised. This affords perhaps an inkling on what
lines the etymological origin of the very ambiguous ἀγαθός is to be
investigated. In the Latin _malus_ (which I place side by side with
μέλας) the vulgar man can be distinguished as the dark-coloured, and
above all as the black-haired ("_hic niger est_"), as the pre-Aryan
inhabitants of the Italian soil, whose complexion formed the clearest
feature of distinction from the dominant blondes, namely, the Aryan
conquering race:--at any rate Gaelic has afforded me the exact
analogue--_Fin_ (for instance, in the name Fin-Gal), the distinctive
word of the nobility, finally--good, noble, clean, but originally the
blonde-haired man in contrast to the dark black-haired aboriginals. The
Celts, if I may make a parenthetic statement, were throughout a blonde
race; and it is wrong to connect, as Virchow still connects, those
traces of an essentially dark-haired population which are to be seen
on the more elaborate ethnographical maps of Germany with any Celtic
ancestry or with any admixture of Celtic blood: in this context it is
rather the _pre-Aryan_ population of Germany which surges up to these
districts. (The same is true substantially of the whole of Europe: in
point of fact, the subject race has finally again obtained the upper
hand, in complexion and the shortness of the skull, and perhaps in
the intellectual and social qualities. Who can guarantee that modern
democracy, still more modern anarchy, and indeed that tendency to the
"Commune," the most primitive form of society, which is now common to
all the Socialists in Europe, does not in its real essence signify a
monstrous reversion--and that the conquering and _master_ race--the
Aryan race, is not also becoming inferior physiologically?) I believe
that I can explain the Latin _bonus_ as the "warrior": my hypothesis
is that I am right in deriving _bonus_ from an older _duonus_ (compare
_bellum_ = _duellum_ = _duen-lum_, in which the word _duonus_ appears
to me to be contained). Bonus accordingly as the man of discord, of
variance, "entzweiung" (_duo_), as the warrior: one sees what in
ancient Rome "the good" meant for a man. Must not our actual German
word _gut_ mean "_the godlike_, the man of godlike race"? and be
identical with the national name (originally the nobles' name) of the
_Goths_?

The grounds for this supposition do not appertain to this work.

Above all, there is no exception (though there are opportunities for
exceptions) to this rule, that the idea of political superiority
always resolves itself into the idea of psychological superiority, in
those cases where the highest caste is at the same time the _priestly_
caste, and in accordance with its general characteristics confers on
itself the privilege of a title which alludes specifically to its
priestly function. It is in these cases, for instance, that "clean" and
"unclean" confront each other for the first time as badges of class
distinction; here again there develops a "good" and a "bad," in a sense
which has ceased to be merely social. Moreover, care should be taken
not to take these ideas of "clean" and "unclean" too seriously, too
broadly, or too symbolically: all the ideas of ancient man have, on
the contrary, got to be understood in their initial stages, in a sense
which is, to an almost inconceivable extent, crude, coarse, physical,
and narrow, and above all essentially unsymbolical. The "clean man" is
originally only a man who washes himself, who abstains from certain
foods which are conducive to skin diseases, who does not sleep with
the unclean women of the lower classes, who has a horror of blood--not
more, not much more! On the other hand, the very nature of a priestly
aristocracy shows the reasons why just at such an early juncture
there should ensue a really dangerous sharpening and intensification
of opposed values: it is, in fact, through these opposed values that
gulfs are cleft in the social plane, which a veritable Achilles of
free thought would shudder to cross. There is from the outset a
certain _diseased taint_ in such sacerdotal aristocracies, and in the
habits which prevail in such societies--habits which, _averse_ as they
are to action, constitute a compound of introspection and explosive
emotionalism, as a result of which there appears that introspective
morbidity and neurasthenia, which adheres almost inevitably to all
priests at all times: with regard, however, to the remedy which they
themselves have invented for this disease--the philosopher has no
option but to state, that it has proved itself in its effects a hundred
times more dangerous than the disease, from which it should have been
the deliverer. Humanity itself is still diseased from the effects of
the naïvetés of this priestly cure. Take, for instance, certain kinds
of diet (abstention from flesh), fasts, sexual continence, flight
into the wilderness (a kind of Weir-Mitchell isolation, though of
course without that system of excessive feeding and fattening which
is the most efficient antidote to all the hysteria of the ascetic
ideal); consider too the whole metaphysic of the priests, with its
war on the senses, its enervation, its hair-splitting; consider its
self-hypnotism on the fakir and Brahman principles (it uses Brahman as
a glass disc and obsession), and that climax which we can understand
only too well of an unusual satiety with its panacea of _nothingness_
(or God:--the demand for a _unio mystica_ with God is the demand of the
Buddhist for nothingness, Nirvana--and nothing else!). In sacerdotal
societies _every_ element is on a more dangerous scale, not merely
cures and remedies, but also pride, revenge, cunning, exaltation, love,
ambition, virtue, morbidity:--further, it can fairly be stated that it
is on the soil of this _essentially dangerous_ form of human society,
the sacerdotal form, that man really becomes for the first time an
_interesting animal_, that it is in this form that the soul of man has
in a higher sense attained _depths_ and become _evil_--and those are
the two fundamental forms of the superiority which up to the present
man has exhibited over every other animal.

The reader will have already surmised with what ease the priestly mode
of valuation can branch off from the knightly aristocratic mode, and
then develop into the very antithesis of the latter: special impetus
is given to this opposition, by every occasion when the castes of the
priests and warriors confront each other with mutual jealousy and
cannot agree over the prize. The knightly-aristocratic "values" are
based on a careful cult of the physical, on a flowering, rich, and
even effervescing healthiness, that goes considerably beyond what
is necessary for maintaining life, on war, adventure, the chase,
the dance, the tourney--on everything, in fact, which is contained
in strong, free, and joyous action. The priestly-aristocratic mode
of valuation is--we have seen--based on other hypotheses: it is bad
enough for this class when it is a question of war! Yet the priests
are, as is notorious, _the worst enemies_--why? Because they are the
weakest. Their weakness causes their hate to expand into a monstrous
and sinister shape, a shape which is most crafty and most poisonous.
The really great haters in the history of the world have always been
priests, who are also the cleverest haters--in comparison with the
cleverness of priestly revenge, every other piece of cleverness is
practically negligible. Human history would be too fatuous for anything
were it not for the cleverness imported into it by the weak--take at
once the most important instance. All the world's efforts against the
"aristocrats," the "mighty," the "masters," the "holders of power,"
are negligible by comparison with what has been accomplished against
those classes by _the Jews_--the Jews, that priestly nation which
eventually realised that the one method of effecting satisfaction on
its enemies and tyrants was by means of a radical transvaluation of
values, which was at the same time an act of the _cleverest revenge_.
Yet the method was only appropriate to a nation of priests, to a nation
of the most jealously nursed priestly revengefulness. It was the Jews
who, in opposition to the aristocratic equation (good = aristocratic
= beautiful = happy = loved by the gods), dared with a terrifying
logic to suggest the contrary equation, and indeed to maintain with
the teeth of the most profound hatred (the hatred of weakness) this
contrary equation, namely, "the wretched are alone the good; the poor,
the weak, the lowly, are alone the good; the suffering, the needy, the
sick, the loathsome, are the only ones who are pious, the only ones
who are blessed, for them alone is salvation--but you, on the other
hand, you aristocrats, you men of power, you are to all eternity the
evil, the horrible, the covetous, the insatiate, the godless; eternally
also shall you be the unblessed, the cursed, the damned!" We know who
it was who reaped the heritage of this Jewish transvaluation. In the
context of the monstrous and inordinately fateful initiative which
the Jews have exhibited in connection with this most fundamental of
all declarations of war, I remember the passage which came to my pen
on another occasion (_Beyond Good and Evil_, Aph. 195)--that it was,
in fact, with the Jews that the _revolt of the slaves_ begins in the
sphere _of morals_; that revolt which has behind it a history of two
millennia, and which at the present day has only moved out of our
sight, because it--has achieved victory.


8.

But you understand this not? You have no eyes for a force which
has taken two thousand years to achieve victory?--There is nothing
wonderful in this: all _lengthy_ processes are hard to see and to
realise. But _this_ is what took place: from the trunk of that tree
of revenge and hate, Jewish hate,--that most profound and sublime
hate, which creates ideals and changes old values to new creations,
the like of which has never been on earth,--there grew a phenomenon
which was equally incomparable, _a new love_, the most profound and
sublime of all kinds of love;--and from what other trunk could it have
grown? But beware of supposing that this love has soared on its upward
growth, as in any way a real negation of that thirst for revenge, as
an antithesis to the Jewish hate! No, the contrary is the truth! This
love grew out of that hate, as its crown, as its triumphant crown,
circling wider and wider amid the clarity and fulness of the sun, and
pursuing in the very kingdom of light and height its goal of hatred,
its victory, its spoil, its strategy, with the same intensity with
which the roots of that tree of hate sank into everything which was
deep and evil with increasing stability and increasing desire. This
Jesus of Nazareth, the incarnate gospel of love, this "Redeemer"
bringing salvation and victory to the poor, the sick, the sinful--was
he not really temptation in its most sinister and irresistible form,
temptation to take the tortuous path to those very _Jewish_ values and
those very Jewish ideals? Has not Israel really obtained the final goal
of its sublime revenge, by the tortuous paths of this "Redeemer," for
all that he might pose as Israel's adversary and Israel's destroyer? Is
it not due to the black magic of a really _great_ policy of revenge,
of a far-seeing, burrowing revenge, both acting and calculating with
slowness, that Israel himself must repudiate before all the world the
actual instrument of his own revenge and nail it to the cross, so
that all the world--that is, all the enemies of Israel--could nibble
without suspicion at this very bait? Could, moreover, any human mind
with all its elaborate ingenuity invent a bait that was more truly
_dangerous_? Anything that was even equivalent in the power of its
seductive, intoxicating, defiling, and corrupting influence to that
symbol of the holy cross, to that awful paradox of a "god on the
cross," to that mystery of the unthinkable, supreme, and utter horror
of the self-crucifixion of a god for the _salvation of man_? It is
at least certain that _sub hoc signo_ Israel, with its revenge and
transvaluation of all values, has up to the present always triumphed
again over all other ideals, over all more aristocratic ideals.


9.

"But why do you talk of nobler ideals? Let us submit to the facts;
that the people have triumphed--or the slaves, or the populace, or the
herd, or whatever name you care to give them--if this has happened
through the Jews, so be it! In that case no nation ever had a greater
mission in the world's history. The 'masters' have been done away
with; the morality of the vulgar man has triumphed. This triumph may
also be called a blood-poisoning (it has mutually fused the races)--I
do not dispute it; but there is no doubt but that this intoxication
has succeeded. The 'redemption' of the human race (that is, from the
masters) is progressing swimmingly; everything is obviously becoming
Judaised, or Christianised, or vulgarised (what is there in the
words?). It seems impossible to stop the course of this poisoning
through the whole body politic of mankind--but its _tempo_ and pace
may from the present time be slower, more delicate, quieter, more
discreet--there is time enough. In view of this context has the Church
nowadays any necessary purpose? has it, in fact, a right to live? Or
could man get on without it? _Quæritur_. It seems that it fetters and
retards this tendency, instead of accelerating it. Well, even that
might be its utility. The Church certainly is a crude and boorish
institution, that is repugnant to an intelligence with any pretence at
delicacy, to a really modern taste. Should it not at any rate learn to
be somewhat more subtle? It alienates nowadays, more than it allures.
Which of us would, forsooth, be a freethinker if there were no Church?
It is the Church which repels us, not its poison--apart from the Church
we like the poison." This is the epilogue of a freethinker to my
discourse, of an honourable animal (as he has given abundant proof),
and a democrat to boot; he had up to that time listened to me, and
could not endure my silence, but for me, indeed, with regard to this
topic there is much on which to be silent.


10.

The revolt of the slaves in morals begins in the very principle of
_resentment_ becoming creative and giving birth to values--a resentment
experienced by creatures who, deprived as they are of the proper outlet
of action, are forced to find their compensation in an imaginary
revenge. While every aristocratic morality springs from a triumphant
affirmation of its own demands, the slave morality says "no" from the
very outset to what is "outside itself," "different from itself," and
"not itself": and this "no" is its creative deed. This volte-face of
the valuing standpoint--this _inevitable_ gravitation to the objective
instead of back to the subjective--is typical of "resentment": the
slave-morality requires as the condition of its existence an external
and objective world, to employ physiological terminology, it requires
objective stimuli to be capable of action at all--its action is
fundamentally a reaction. The contrary is the case when we come to
the aristocrat's system of values: it acts and grows spontaneously,
it merely seeks its antithesis in order to pronounce a more grateful
and exultant "yes" to its own self;--its negative conception, "low,"
"vulgar," "bad," is merely a pale late-born foil in comparison with its
positive and fundamental conception (saturated as it is with life and
passion), of "we aristocrats, we good ones, we beautiful ones, we happy
ones."

When the aristocratic morality goes astray and commits sacrilege on
reality, this is limited to that particular sphere with which it
is _not_ sufficiently acquainted--a sphere, in fact, from the real
knowledge of which it disdainfully defends itself. It misjudges, in
some cases, the sphere which it despises, the sphere of the common
vulgar man and the low people: on the other hand, due weight should be
given to the consideration that in any case the mood of contempt, of
disdain, of superciliousness, even on the supposition that it _falsely_
portrays the object of its contempt, will always be far removed from
that degree of falsity which will always characterise the attacks--in
effigy, of course--of the vindictive hatred and revengefulness of
the weak in onslaughts on their enemies. In point of fact, there is
in contempt too strong an admixture of nonchalance, of casualness,
of boredom, of impatience, even of personal exultation, for it to be
capable of distorting its victim into a real caricature or a real
monstrosity. Attention again should be paid to the almost benevolent
_nuances_ which, for instance, the Greek nobility imports into all
the words by which it distinguishes the common people from itself;
note how continuously a kind of pity, care, and consideration imparts
its honeyed _flavour_, until at last almost all the words which are
applied to the vulgar man survive finally as expressions for "unhappy,"
"worthy of pity" (compare δειλο, δείλαιος, πονηρός, μοχθηρός]; the
latter two names really denoting the vulgar man as labour-slave
and beast of burden)--and how, conversely, "bad," "low," "unhappy"
have never ceased to ring in the Greek ear with a tone in which
"unhappy" is the predominant note: this is a heritage of the old noble
aristocratic morality, which remains true to itself even in contempt
(let philologists remember the sense in which ὀιζυρός, ἄνολβος, τλήμων,
δυστυχεῑν, ξυμφορά used to be employed). The "well-born" simply
_felt_ themselves the "happy"; they did not have to manufacture their
happiness artificially through looking at their enemies, or in cases
to talk and _lie themselves_ into happiness (as is the custom with all
resentful men); and similarly, complete men as they were, exuberant
with strength, and consequently _necessarily_ energetic, they were too
wise to dissociate happiness from action--activity becomes in their
minds necessarily counted as happiness (that is the etymology of εὖ
πρἆττειν)--all in sharp contrast to the "happiness" of the weak and
the oppressed, with their festering venom and malignity, among whom
happiness appears essentially as a narcotic, a deadening, a quietude,
a peace, a "Sabbath," an enervation of the mind and relaxation
of the limbs,--in short, a purely _passive_ phenomenon. While the
aristocratic man lived in confidence and openness with himself
(gennaios, "noble-born," emphasises the nuance "sincere," and perhaps
also "naïf"), the resentful man, on the other hand, is neither sincere
nor naïf, nor honest and candid with himself. His soul _squints_; his
mind loves hidden crannies, tortuous paths and back-doors, everything
secret appeals to him as _his_ world, _his_ safety, _his_ balm; he is
past master in silence, in not forgetting, in waiting, in provisional
self-depreciation and self-abasement. A race of such _resentful_ men
will of necessity eventually prove more _prudent_ than any aristocratic
race, it will honour prudence on quite a distinct scale, as, in fact, a
paramount condition of existence, while prudence among aristocratic men
is apt to be tinged with a delicate flavour of luxury and refinement;
so among them it plays nothing like so integral a part as that complete
certainty of function of the governing _unconscious_ instincts, or
as indeed a certain lack of prudence, such as a vehement and valiant
charge, whether against danger or the enemy, or as those ecstatic
bursts of rage, love, reverence, gratitude, by which at all times
noble souls have recognised each other. When the resentment of the
aristocratic man manifests itself, it fulfils and exhausts itself in
an immediate reaction, and consequently instills no _venom_: on the
other hand, it never manifests itself at all in countless instances,
when in the case of the feeble and weak it would be inevitable. An
inability to take seriously for any length of time their enemies,
their disasters, their _misdeeds_--that is the sign of the full strong
natures who possess a superfluity of moulding plastic force, that
heals completely and produces forgetfulness: a good example of this in
the modern world is Mirabeau, who had no memory for any insults and
meannesses which were practised on him, and who was only incapable
of forgiving because he forgot. Such a man indeed shakes off with a
shrug many a worm which would have buried itself in another; it is
only in characters like these that we see the possibility (supposing,
of course, that there is such a possibility in the world) of the real
"_love_ of one's enemies." What respect for his enemies is found,
forsooth, in an aristocratic man--and such a reverence is already
a bridge to love! He insists on having his enemy to himself as his
distinction. He tolerates no other enemy but a man in whose character
there is nothing to despise and much to honour! On the other hand,
imagine the "enemy" as the resentful man conceives him--and it is here
exactly that we see his work, his creativeness; he has conceived "the
evil enemy," the "evil one," and indeed that is the root idea from
which he now evolves as a contrasting and corresponding figure a "good
one," himself--his very self!


11

The method of this man is quite contrary to that of the aristocratic
man, who conceives the root idea "good" spontaneously and straight
away, that is to say, out of himself, and from that material then
creates for himself a concept of "bad"! This "bad" of aristocratic
origin and that "evil" out of the cauldron of unsatisfied hatred--the
former an imitation, an "extra," an additional nuance; the latter,
on the other hand, the original, the beginning, the essential act in
the conception of a slave-morality--these two words "bad" and "evil,"
how great a difference do they mark, in spite of the fact that they
have an identical contrary in the idea "good." But the idea "good" is
not the same: much rather let the question be asked, "Who is really
evil according to the meaning of the morality of resentment?" In
all sternness let it be answered thus:--_just_ the good man of the
other morality, just the aristocrat, the powerful one, the one who
rules, but who is distorted by the venomous eye of resentfulness,
into a new colour, a new signification, a new appearance. This
particular point we would be the last to deny: the man who learnt to
know those "good" ones only as enemies, learnt at the same time not
to know them only as "_evil enemies_" and the same men who _inter
pares_ were kept so rigorously in bounds through convention, respect,
custom, and gratitude, though much more through mutual vigilance
and jealousy _inter pares_, these men who in their relations with
each other find so many new ways of manifesting consideration,
self-control, delicacy, loyalty, pride, and friendship, these men
are in reference to what is outside their circle (where the foreign
element, a _foreign_ country, begins), not much better than beasts
of prey, which have been let loose. They enjoy there freedom from
all social control, they feel that in the wilderness they can give
vent with impunity to that tension which is produced by enclosure and
imprisonment in the peace of society, they _revert_ to the innocence
of the beast-of-prey conscience, like jubilant monsters, who perhaps
come from a ghastly bout of murder, arson, rape, and torture, with
bravado and a moral equanimity, as though merely some wild student's
prank had been played, perfectly convinced that the poets have now an
ample theme to sing and celebrate. It is impossible not to recognise
at the core of all these aristocratic races the beast of prey; the
magnificent _blonde brute_, avidly rampant for spoil and victory;
this hidden core needed an outlet from time to time, the beast must
get loose again, must return into the wilderness--the Roman, Arabic,
German, and Japanese nobility, the Homeric heroes, the Scandinavian
Vikings, are all alike in this need. It is the aristocratic races who
have left the idea "Barbarian" on all the tracks in which they have
marched; nay, a consciousness of this very barbarianism, and even
a pride in it, manifests itself even in their highest civilisation
(for example, when Pericles says to his Athenians in that celebrated
funeral oration, "Our audacity has forced a way over every land and
sea, rearing everywhere imperishable memorials of itself for _good_
and for _evil_"). This audacity of aristocratic races, mad, absurd,
and spasmodic as may be its expression; the incalculable and fantastic
nature of their enterprises,Pericles sets in special relief and
glory the ᾽ραθυμία of the Athenians, their nonchalance and contempt for
safety, body, life, and comfort, their awful joy and intense delight
in all destruction, in all the ecstasies of victory and cruelty,--all
these features become crystallised, for those who suffered thereby
in the picture of the "barbarian," of the "evil enemy," perhaps of
the "Goth" and of the "Vandal." The profound, icy mistrust which
the German provokes, as soon as he arrives at power,--even at the
present time,--is always still an aftermath of that inextinguishable
horror with which for whole centuries Europe has regarded the wrath
of the blonde Teuton beast (although between the old Germans and
ourselves there exists scarcely a psychological, let alone a physical,
relationship). I have once called attention to the embarrassment of
Hesiod, when he conceived the series of social ages, and endeavoured
to express them in gold, silver, and bronze. He could only dispose
of the contradiction, with which he was confronted, by the Homeric
world, an age magnificent indeed, but at the same time so awful and
so violent, by making two ages out of one, which he henceforth placed
one behind each other--first, the age of the heroes and demigods, as
that world had remained in the memories of the aristocratic families,
who found therein their own ancestors; secondly, the bronze age, as
that corresponding age appeared to the descendants of the oppressed,
spoiled, ill-treated, exiled, enslaved; namely, as an age of bronze,
as I have said, hard, cold, terrible, without feelings and without
conscience, crushing everything, and bespattering everything with
blood. Granted the truth of the theory now believed to be true, that
the very _essence of all civilisation_ is to _train_ out of man, the
beast of prey, a tame and civilised animal, a domesticated animal,
it follows indubitably that we must regard as the real _tools of
civilisation_ all those instincts of reaction and resentment, by the
help of which the aristocratic races, together with their ideals,
were finally degraded and overpowered; though that has not yet come
to be synonymous with saying that the bearers of those tools also
_represented_ the civilisation. It is rather the contrary that is
not only probable--nay, it is _palpable_ to-day; these bearers of
vindictive instincts that have to be bottled up, these descendants of
all European and non-European slavery, especially of the pre-Aryan
population--these people, I say, represent the _decline_ of humanity!
These "tools of civilisation" are a disgrace to humanity, and
constitute in reality more of an argument against civilisation, more
of a reason why civilisation should be suspected. One may be perfectly
justified in being always afraid of the blonde beast that lies at
the core of all aristocratic races, and in being on one's guard: but
who would not a hundred times prefer to be afraid, when one at the
same time admires, than to be immune from fear, at the cost of being
perpetually obsessed with the loathsome spectacle of the distorted, the
dwarfed, the stunted, the envenomed? And is that not our fate? What
produces to-day our repulsion towards "man"?--for we _suffer_ from
"man," there is no doubt about it. It is not fear; it is rather that
we have nothing more to fear from men; it is that the worm "man" is in
the foreground and pullulates; it is that the "tame man," the wretched
mediocre and unedifying creature, has learnt to consider himself a goal
and a pinnacle, an inner meaning, an historic principle, a "higher
man"; yes, it is that he has a certain right so to consider himself,
in so far as he feels that in contrast to that excess of deformity,
disease, exhaustion, and effeteness whose odour is beginning to pollute
present-day Europe, he at any rate has achieved a relative success, he
at any rate still says "yes" to life.


12.

I cannot refrain at this juncture from uttering a sigh and one last
hope. What is it precisely which I find intolerable? That which I alone
cannot get rid of, which makes me choke and faint? Bad air! bad air!
That something misbegotten comes near me; that I must inhale the odour
of the entrails of a misbegotten soul!--That excepted, what can one
not endure in the way of need, privation, bad weather, sickness, toil,
solitude? In point of fact, one manages to get over everything, born
as one is to a burrowing and battling existence; one always returns
once again to the light, one always lives again one's golden hour of
victory--and then one stands as one was born, unbreakable, tense, ready
for something more difficult, for something more distant, like a bow
stretched but the tauter by every strain. But from time to time do ye
grant me--assuming that "beyond good and evil" there are goddesses who
can grant--one glimpse, grant me but one glimpse only, of something
perfect, fully realised, happy, mighty, triumphant, of something
that still gives cause for fear! A glimpse of a man that justifies
the existence of man, a glimpse of an incarnate human happiness that
realises and redeems, for the sake of which one may hold fast to _the
belief in man_! For the position is this: in the dwarfing and levelling
of the European man lurks _our_ greatest peril, for it is this outlook
which fatigues--we see to-day nothing which wishes to be greater, we
surmise that the process is always still backwards, still backwards
towards something more attenuated, more inoffensive, more cunning,
more comfortable, more mediocre, more indifferent, more Chinese, more
Christian--man, there is no doubt about it, grows always "better"
--the destiny of Europe lies even in this--that in losing the fear of
man, we have also lost the hope in man, yea, the will to be man. The
sight of man now fatigues.--What is present-day Nihilism if it is not
_that_?--We are tired of _man_.


13.

But let us come back to it; the problem of another origin of the
_good_--of the good, as the resentful man has thought it out--demands
its solution. It is not surprising that the lambs should bear a grudge
against the great birds of prey, but that is no reason for blaming the
great birds of prey for taking the little lambs. And when the lambs
say among themselves, "These birds of prey are evil, and he who is as
far removed from being a bird of prey, who is rather its opposite,
a lamb,--is he not good?" then there is nothing to cavil at in the
setting up of this ideal, though it may also be that the birds of prey
will regard it a little sneeringly, and perchance say to themselves,
"_We_ bear no grudge against them, these good lambs, we even like them:
nothing is tastier than a tender lamb." To require of strength that it
should not express itself as strength, that it should not be a wish to
overpower, a wish to overthrow, a wish to become master, a thirst for
enemies and antagonisms and triumphs, is just as absurd as to require
of weakness that it should express itself as strength. A quantum of
force is just such a quantum of movement, will, action--rather it
is nothing else than just those very phenomena of moving, willing,
acting, and can only appear otherwise in the misleading errors of
language (and the fundamental fallacies of reason which have become
petrified therein), which understands, and understands wrongly, all
working as conditioned by a worker, by a "subject." And just exactly
as the people separate the lightning from its flash, and interpret the
latter as a thing done, as the working of a subject which is called
lightning, so also does the popular morality separate strength from the
expression of strength, as though behind the strong man there existed
some indifferent neutral _substratum_, which enjoyed a _caprice and
option_ as to whether or not it should express strength. But there
is no such _substratum_, there is no "being" behind doing, working,
becoming; "the doer" is a mere appanage to the action. The action is
everything. In point of fact, the people duplicate the doing, when they
make the lightning lighten, that is a "doing-doing": they make the same
phenomenon first a cause, and then, secondly, the effect of that cause.
The scientists fail to improve matters when they say, "Force moves,
force causes," and so on. Our whole science is still, in spite of all
its coldness, of all its freedom from passion, a dupe of the tricks of
language, and has never succeeded in getting rid of that superstitious
changeling "the subject" (the atom, to give another instance, is such
a changeling, just as the Kantian "Thing-in-itself"). What wonder,
if the suppressed and stealthily simmering passions of revenge and
hatred exploit for their own advantage this belief, and indeed hold no
belief with a more steadfast enthusiasm than this--"that the strong
has the _option_ of being weak, and the bird of prey of being a lamb."
Thereby do they win for themselves the right of attributing to the
birds of prey the _responsibility_ for being birds of prey: when the
oppressed, down-trodden, and overpowered say to themselves with the
vindictive guile of weakness, "Let us be otherwise than the evil,
namely, good! and good is every one who does not oppress, who hurts
no one, who does not attack, who does not pay back, who hands over
revenge to God, who holds himself, as we do, in hiding; who goes out
of the way of evil, and demands, in short, little from life; like
ourselves the patient, the meek, the just,"--yet all this, in its cold
and unprejudiced interpretation, means nothing more than "once for
all, the weak are weak; it is good to do _nothing for which we are not
strong enough_"; but this dismal state of affairs, this prudence of the
lowest order, which even insects possess (which in a great danger are
fain to sham death so as to avoid doing "too much"), has, thanks to
the counterfeiting and self-deception of weakness, come to masquerade
in the pomp of an ascetic, mute, and expectant virtue, just as though
the _very_ weakness of the weak--that is, forsooth, its _being_, its
working, its whole unique inevitable inseparable reality--were a
voluntary result, something wished, chosen, a deed, an act of _merit_.
This kind of man finds the belief in a neutral, free-choosing "subject"
_necessary_ from an instinct of self-preservation, of self-assertion,
in which every lie is fain to sanctify itself. The subject (or, to
use popular language, the _soul_) has perhaps proved itself the best
dogma in the world simply because it rendered possible to the horde
of mortal, weak, and oppressed individuals of every kind, that most
sublime specimen of self-deception, the interpretation of weakness as
freedom, of being this, or being that, as _merit_.


14.

Will any one look a little into--right into--the mystery of how _ideals
are manufactured_ in this world? Who has the courage to do it? Come!

Here we have a vista opened into these grimy workshops. Wait just a
moment, dear Mr. Inquisitive and Foolhardy; your eye must first grow
accustomed to this false changing light--Yes! Enough! Now speak! What
is happening below down yonder? Speak out that what you see, man of the
most dangerous curiosity--for now _I_ am the listener.

"I see nothing, I hear the more. It is a cautious, spiteful, gentle
whispering and muttering together in all the corners and crannies. It
seems to me that they are lying; a sugary softness adheres to every
sound. Weakness is turned to _merit_, there is no doubt about it--it is
just as you say."

Further!

"And the impotence which requites not, is turned to 'goodness,' craven
baseness to meekness, submission to those whom one hates, to obedience
(namely, obedience to one of whom they say that he ordered this
submission--they call him God). The inoffensive character of the weak,
the very cowardice in which he is rich, his standing at the door, his
forced necessity of waiting, gain here fine names, such as 'patience,'
which is also called 'virtue'; not being able to avenge one's self, is
called not wishing to avenge one's self, perhaps even forgiveness (for
_they_ know not what they do--we alone know what _they_ do). They also
talk of the 'love of their enemies' and sweat thereby."

Further!

"They are miserable, there is no doubt about it, all these whisperers
and counterfeiters in the corners, although they try to get warm by
crouching close to each other, but they tell me that their misery is
a favour and distinction given to them by God, just as one beats the
dogs one likes best; that perhaps this misery is also a preparation, a
probation, a training; that perhaps it is still more something which
will one day be compensated and paid back with a tremendous interest in
gold, nay in happiness. This they call 'Blessedness.'"

Further!

"They are now giving me to understand, that not only are they better
men than the mighty, the lords of the earth, whose spittle they have
got to lick (not out of fear, not at all out of fear! But because
God ordains that one should honour all authority)--not only are they
better men, but that they also have a 'better time,' at any rate,
will one day have a 'better time.' But enough! Enough! I can endure
it no longer. Bad air! Bad air! These workshops _where ideals are
manufactured_--verily they reek with the crassest lies."

Nay. Just one minute! You are saying nothing about the masterpieces
of these virtuosos of black magic, who can produce whiteness, milk,
and innocence out of any black you like: have you not noticed what a
pitch of refinement is attained by their _chef d'œuvre_, their most
audacious, subtle, ingenious, and lying artist-trick? Take care! These
cellar-beasts, full of revenge and hate--what do they make, forsooth,
out of their revenge and hate? Do you hear these words? Would you
suspect, if you trusted only their words, that you are among men of
resentment and nothing else?

"I understand, I prick my ears up again (ah! ah! ah! and I hold my
nose). Now do I hear for the first time that which they have said so
often: 'We good, _we are the righteous_'--what they demand they call
not revenge but 'the triumph of _righteousness_'; what they hate is
not their enemy, no, they hate 'unrighteousness,' 'godlessness'; what
they believe in and hope is not the hope of revenge, the intoxication
of sweet revenge (--"sweeter than honey," did Homer call it?), but the
victory of God, of the _righteous_ _God_ over the 'godless'; what is
left for them to love in this world is not _their_ brothers in hate,
but their 'brothers in love,' as they say, all the good and righteous
on the earth."

And how do they name that which serves them as a solace against all
the troubles of life--their phantasmagoria of their anticipated future
blessedness?

"How? Do I hear right? They call it 'the last judgment,' the advent of
their kingdom, 'the kingdom of God'--but _in the meanwhile_ they live
'in faith,' 'in love,' 'in hope.'"

Enough! Enough!


15.

In the faith in what? In the love for what? In the hope of what? These
weaklings!--they also, forsooth, wish to be the strong some time; there
is no doubt about it, some time _their_ kingdom also must come--"the
kingdom of God" is their name for it, as has been mentioned: they are
so meek in everything! Yet in order to experience _that_ kingdom it
is necessary to live long, to live beyond death,--yes, _eternal_ life
is necessary so that one can make up for ever for that earthly life
"in faith," "in love," "in hope." Make up for what? Make up by what?
Dante, as it seems to me, made a crass mistake when with awe-inspiring
ingenuity he placed that inscription over the gate of his hell, "Me too
made eternal love": at any rate the following inscription would have
a much better right to stand over the gate of the Christian Paradise
and its "eternal blessedness"--"Me too made eternal hate"--granted
of course that a truth may rightly stand over the gate to a lie! For
what is the blessedness of that Paradise? Possibly we could quickly
surmise it; but it is better that it should be explicitly attested by
an authority who in such matters is not to be disparaged, Thomas of
Aquinas, the great teacher and saint. "_Beati in regno celesti_" says
he, as gently as a lamb, "_videbunt pœnas damnatorum, ut beatitudo
illis magis complaceat_." Or if we wish to hear a stronger tone, a word
from the mouth of a triumphant father of the Church, who warned his
disciples against the cruel ecstasies of the public spectacles--But
why? Faith offers us much more,--says he, _de Spectac._, c. 29
ss.,--something much stronger; thanks to the redemption, joys of quite
another kind stand at our disposal; instead of athletes we have our
martyrs; we wish for blood, well, we have the blood of Christ--but
what then awaits us on the day of his return, of his triumph. And
then does he proceed, does this enraptured visionary: "_at enim
supersunt alia spectacula, ille ultimas et perpetuus judicii dies, ille
nationibus insperatus, ille derisus, cum tanta sæculi vetustas et tot
ejus nativitates uno igne haurientur. Quæ tunc spectaculi latitudo!
Quid admirer! quid rideam! Ubigaudeam! Ubi exultem, spectans tot et
tantos reges, qui in cœlum recepti nuntiabantur, cum ipso Jove et ipsis
suis testibus in imis tenebris congemescentes! Item præsides_" (the
provincial governors) "_persecutores dominici nominis sævioribus quam
ipsi flammis sævierunt insultantibus contra Christianos liquescentes!
Quos præterea sapientes illos philosophos coram discipulis suis una
conflagrantibus erubescentes, quibus nihil ad deum pertinere suadebant,
quibus animas aut nullas aut non in pristina corpora redituras
affirmabant! Etiam poetas non ad Rhadamanti nec ad Minois, sed ad
inopinati Christi tribunal palpitantes! Tunc magis tragœdi audiendi,
magis scilicet vocales_" (with louder tones and more violent shrieks)
"_in sua propria calamitate; tunc histriones cognoscendi, solutiores
multo per ignem; tunc spectandus auriga in flammea rota totus rubens,
tunc xystici contemplandi non in gymnasiis, sed in igne jaculati, nisi
quod ne tunc quidem illos velim vivos, ut qui malim ad eos potius
conspectum insatiabilem conferre, qui in dominum scevierunt. Hic est
ille, dicam fabri aut quæstuariæ filius_" (as is shown by the whole of
the following, and in particular by this well-known description of the
mother of Jesus from the Talmud, Tertullian is henceforth referring to
the Jews), "_sabbati destructor, Samarites et dæmonium habens. Hic est
quem a Juda redemistis, hic est ille arundine et colaphis diverberatus,
sputamentis de decoratus, felle et acete potatus. Hic est, quem
clam discentes subripuerunt, ut resurrexisse dicatur vel hortulanus
detraxit, ne lactucæ suæ frequentia commeantium laderentur. Ut talia
species, ut talibus exultes, quis tibi prætor aut consul aut sacerdos
de sua liberalitate prastabit? Et tamen hæc jam habemus quodammodo per
fidem spiritu imaginante repræsentata. Ceterum qualia illa sunt, quæ
nec oculus vidit nec auris audivit nec in cor hominis ascenderunt?_" (I
Cor. ii. 9.) "_Credo circo et utraque cavea_" (first and fourth row,
or, according to others, the comic and the tragic stage) "_et omni
studio gratiora._" _Per fidem_: so stands it written.


16.

Let us come to a conclusion. The two _opposing values_, "good and bad,"
"good and evil," have fought a dreadful, thousand-year fight in the
world, and though indubitably the second value has been for a long time
in the preponderance, there are not wanting places where the fortune
of the fight is still undecisive. It can almost be said that in the
meanwhile the fight reaches a higher and higher level, and that in the
meanwhile it has become more and more intense, and always more and more
psychological; so that nowadays there is perhaps no more decisive mark
of the _higher nature_, of the more psychological nature, than to be in
that sense self-contradictory, and to be actually still a battleground
for those two opposites. The symbol of this fight, written in a writing
which has remained worthy of perusal throughout the course of history
up to the present time, is called "Rome against Judæa, Judæa against
Rome." Hitherto there has been no greater event than _that_ fight,
the putting of _that_ question, _that_ deadly antagonism. Rome found
in the Jew the incarnation of the unnatural, as though it were its
diametrically opposed monstrosity, and in Rome the Jew was held to
be _convicted of hatred_ of the whole human race: and rightly so, in
so far as it is right to link the well-being and the future of the
human race to the unconditional mastery of the aristocratic values, of
the Roman values. What, conversely, did the Jews feel against Rome?
One can surmise it from a thousand symptoms, but it is sufficient to
carry one's mind back to the Johannian Apocalypse, that most obscene
of all the written outbursts, which has revenge on its conscience.
(One should also appraise at its full value the profound logic of the
Christian instinct, when over this very book of hate it wrote the name
of the Disciple of Love, that self-same disciple to whom it attributed
that impassioned and ecstatic Gospel--therein lurks a portion of
truth, however much literary forging may have been necessary for
this purpose.) The Romans were the strong and aristocratic; a nation
stronger and more aristocratic has never existed in the world, has
never even been dreamed of; every relic of them, every inscription
enraptures, granted that one can divine _what_ it is that writes the
inscription. The Jews, conversely, were that priestly nation of
resentment par excellence, possessed by a unique genius for popular
morals: just compare with the Jews the nations with analogous gifts,
such as the Chinese or the Germans, so as to realise afterwards what is
first rate, and what is fifth rate.

Which of them has been provisionally victorious, Rome or Judæa? but
there is not a shadow of doubt; just consider to whom in Rome itself
nowadays you bow down, as though before the quintessence of all the
highest values--and not only in Rome, but almost over half the world,
everywhere where man has been tamed or is about to be tamed--to _three
Jews_, as we know, and _one Jewess_ (to Jesus of Nazareth, to Peter
the fisher, to Paul the tent-maker, and to the mother of the aforesaid
Jesus, named Mary). This is very remarkable: Rome is undoubtedly
defeated. At any rate there took place in the Renaissance a brilliantly
sinister revival of the classical ideal, of the aristocratic valuation
of all things: Rome herself, like a man waking up from a trance,
stirred beneath the burden of the new Judaised Rome that had been built
over her, which presented the appearance of an œcumenical synagogue
and was called the "Church": but immediately Judæa triumphed again,
thanks to that fundamentally popular (German and English) movement
of revenge, which is called the Reformation, and taking also into
account its inevitable corollary, the restoration of the Church--the
restoration also of the ancient graveyard peace of classical Rome.
Judæa proved yet once more victorious over the classical ideal in the
French Revolution, and in a sense which was even more crucial and even
more profound: the last political aristocracy that existed in Europe,
that of the _French_ seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, broke into
pieces beneath the instincts of a resentful populace--never had the
world heard a greater jubilation, a more uproarious enthusiasm: indeed,
there took place in the midst of it the most monstrous and unexpected
phenomenon; the ancient ideal _itself_ swept before the eyes and
conscience of humanity with all its life and with unheard-of splendour,
and in opposition to resentment's lying war-cry of _the prerogative
of the most_, in opposition to the will to lowliness, abasement, and
equalisation, the will to a retrogression and twilight of humanity,
there rang out once again, stronger, simpler, more penetrating than
ever, the terrible and enchanting counter-warcry of _the prerogative of
the few_! Like a final signpost to other ways, there appeared Napoleon,
the most unique and violent anachronism that ever existed, and in him
the incarnate problem _of the aristocratic ideal in itself_--consider
well what a problem it is:--Napoleon, that synthesis of Monster and
Superman.


17.

Was it therewith over? Was that greatest of all antitheses of ideals
thereby relegated _ad acta_ for all time? Or only postponed, postponed
for a long time? May there not take place at some time or other a
much more awful, much more carefully prepared flaring up of the old
conflagration? Further! Should not one wish _that_ consummation with
all one's strength?--will it one's self? demand it one's self? He who
at this juncture begins, like my readers, to reflect, to think further,
will have difficulty in coming quickly to a conclusion,--ground enough
for me to come myself to a conclusion, taking it for granted that for
some time past what I mean has been sufficiently clear, what I exactly
_mean_ by that dangerous motto which is inscribed on the body of my
last book: _Beyond Good and Evil_--at any rate that is not the same as
"Beyond Good and Bad."


Note.--I avail myself of the opportunity offered by this treatise to
express, openly and formally, a wish which up to the present has only
been expressed in occasional conversations with scholars, namely,
that some Faculty of philosophy should, by means of a series of prize
essays, gain the glory of having promoted the further study of the
_history of morals_--perhaps this book may serve to give forcible
impetus in such a direction. With regard to a possibility of this
character, the following question deserves consideration. It merits
quite as much the attention of philologists and historians as of actual
professional philosophers.

"_What indication of the history of the evolution of the moral ideas is
afforded by philology, and especially by etymological investigation?_"

On the other hand, it is of course equally necessary to induce
physiologists and doctors to be interested in these problems (_of the
value of the valuations_ which have prevailed up to the present): in
this connection the professional philosophers may be trusted to act
as the spokesmen and intermediaries in these particular instances,
after, of course, they have quite succeeded in transforming the
relationship between philosophy and physiology and medicine, which
is originally one of coldness and suspicion, into the most friendly
and fruitful reciprocity. In point of fact, all tables of values,
all the "thou shalts" known to history and ethnology, need primarily
a _physiological_, at any rate in preference to a psychological,
elucidation and interpretation; all equally require a critique from
medical science. The question, "What is the _value_ of this or that
table of 'values' and morality?" will be asked from the most varied
standpoints. For instance, the question of "valuable _for what_" can
never be analysed with sufficient nicety. That, for instance, which
would evidently have value with regard to promoting in a race the
greatest possible powers of endurance (or with regard to increasing its
adaptability to a specific climate, or with regard to the preservation
of the greatest number) would have nothing like the same value, if it
were a question of evolving a stronger species. In gauging values,
the good of the majority and the good of the minority are opposed
standpoints: we leave it to the naïveté of English biologists to regard
the former standpoint as _intrinsically_ superior. _All_ the sciences
have now to pave the way for the future task of the philosopher; this
task being understood to mean, that he must solve the problem of
_value_, that he has to fix the _hierarchy of values_.




SECOND ESSAY. "GUILT," "BAD CONSCIENCE," AND THE LIKE.


1.

The breeding of an animal that _can promise_--is not this just that
very paradox of a task which nature has set itself in regard to man? Is
not this the very problem of man? The fact that this problem has been
to a great extent solved, must appear all the more phenomenal to one
who can estimate at its full value that force of _forgetfulness_ which
works in opposition to it. Forgetfulness is no mere _vis inertiæ_,
as the superficial believe, rather is it a power of obstruction,
active and, in the strictest sense of the word, positive--a power
responsible for the fact that what we have lived, experienced, taken
into ourselves, no more enters into consciousness during the process
of digestion (it might be called psychic absorption) than all the
whole manifold process by which our physical nutrition, the so-called
"incorporation," is carried on. The temporary shutting of the doors
and windows of consciousness, the relief from the clamant alarums and
excursions, with which our subconscious world of servant organs works
in mutual co-operation and antagonism; a little quietude, a little
_tabula rasa_ of the consciousness, so as to make room again for the
new, and above all for the more noble functions and functionaries, room
for government, foresight, predetermination (for our organism is on an
oligarchic model)--this is the utility, as I have said, of the active
forgetfulness, which is a very sentinel and nurse of psychic order,
repose, etiquette; and this shows at once why it is that there can
exist no happiness, no gladness, no hope, no pride, no real _present_,
without forgetfulness. The man in whom this preventative apparatus is
damaged and discarded, is to be compared to a dyspeptic, and it is
something more than a comparison--he can "get rid of" nothing. But
this very animal who finds it necessary to be forgetful, in whom, in
fact, forgetfulness represents a force and a form of _robust_ health,
has reared for himself an opposition-power, a memory, with whose help
forgetfulness is, in certain instances, kept in check--in the cases,
namely, where promises have to be made;--so that it is by no means
a mere passive inability to get rid of a once indented impression,
not merely the indigestion occasioned by a once pledged word, which
one cannot dispose of, but an _active_ refusal to get rid of it, a
continuing and a wish to continue what has once been willed, an actual
_memory of the will_; so that between the original "I will," "I shall
do," and the actual discharge of the will, its act, we can easily
interpose a world of new strange phenomena, circumstances, veritable
volitions, without the snapping of this long chain of the will. But
what is the underlying hypothesis of all this? How thoroughly, in order
to be able to regulate the future in this way, must man have first
learnt to distinguish between necessitated and accidental phenomena, to
think causally, to see the distant as present and to anticipate it, to
fix with certainty what is the end, and what is the means to that end;
above all, to reckon, to have power to calculate--how thoroughly must
man have first become _calculable, disciplined, necessitated_ even for
himself and his own conception of himself, that, like a man entering
into a promise, he could guarantee himself _as a future_.


2.

This is simply the long history of the origin of _responsibility_.
That task of breeding an animal which can make promises, includes, as
we have already grasped, as its condition and preliminary, the more
immediate task of first _making_ man to a certain extent, necessitated,
uniform, like among his like, regular, and consequently calculable. The
immense work of what I have called, "morality of custom"[1] (cp. _Dawn
of Day_, Aphs. 9, 14, and 16), the actual work of man on himself during
the longest period of the human race, his whole prehistoric work,
finds its meaning, its great justification (in spite of all its innate
hardness, despotism, stupidity, and idiocy) in this fact: man, with
the help of the morality of customs and of social strait-waistcoats,
was _made_ genuinely calculable. If, however, we place ourselves at
the end of this colossal process, at the point where the tree finally
matures its fruits, when society and its morality of custom finally
bring to light that to which it was only the means, then do we find as
the ripest fruit on its tree the _sovereign individual_, that resembles
only himself, that has got loose from the morality of custom, the
autonomous "super-moral" individual (for "autonomous" and "moral" are
mutually-exclusive terms),--in short, the man of the personal, long,
and independent will, _competent to promise_, and we find in him a
proud consciousness (vibrating in every fibre), of _what_ has been at
last achieved and become vivified in him, a genuine consciousness of
power and freedom, a feeling of human perfection in general. And this
man who has grown to freedom, who is really _competent_ to promise,
this lord of the _free_ will, this sovereign--how is it possible for
him not to know how great is his superiority over everything incapable
of binding itself by promises, or of being its own security, how great
is the trust, the awe, the reverence that he awakes--he "deserves"
all three--not to know that with this mastery over himself he is
necessarily also given the mastery over circumstances, over nature,
over all creatures with shorter wills, less reliable characters?
The "free" man, the owner of a long unbreakable will, finds in this
possession his _standard of value_: looking out from himself upon
the others, he honours or he despises, and just as necessarily as he
honours his peers, the strong and the reliable (those who can bind
themselves by promises),--that is, every one who promises like a
sovereign, with difficulty, rarely and slowly, who is sparing with his
trusts but confers _honour_ by the very fact of trusting, who gives
his word as something that can be relied on, because he knows himself
strong enough to keep it even in the teeth of disasters, even in the
"teeth of fate,"--so with equal necessity will he have the heel of his
foot ready for the lean and empty jackasses, who promise when they have
no business to do so, and his rod of chastisement ready for the liar,
who already breaks his word at the very minute when it is on his lips.
The proud knowledge of the extraordinary privilege of _responsibility_,
the consciousness of this rare freedom, of this power over himself and
over fate, has sunk right down to his innermost depths, and has become
an instinct, a dominating instinct--what name will he give to it, to
this dominating instinct, if he needs to have a word for it? But there
is no doubt about it--the sovereign man calls it his _conscience_.


3.

His conscience?--One apprehends at once that the idea "conscience,"
which is here seen in its supreme manifestation, supreme in fact to
almost the point of strangeness, should already have behind it a long
history and evolution. The ability to guarantee one's self with all
due pride, and also at the same time to _say yes_ to one's self--that
is, as has been said, a ripe fruit, but also a _late_ fruit:--How long
must needs this fruit hang sour and bitter on the tree! And for an even
longer period there was not a glimpse of such a fruit to to be had--no
one had taken it on himself to promise it, although everything on the
tree was quite ready for it, and everything was maturing for that very
consummation. "How is a memory to be made for the man-animal? How is an
impression to be so deeply fixed upon this ephemeral understanding,
half dense, and half silly, upon this incarnate forgetfulness, that
it will be permanently present?" As one may imagine, this primeval
problem was not solved by exactly gentle answers and gentle means;
perhaps there is nothing more awful and more sinister in the early
history of man than his _system of mnemonics_. "Something is burnt in
so as to remain in his memory: only that which never stops _hurting_
remains in his memory." This is an axiom of the oldest (unfortunately
also the longest) psychology in the world. It might even be said that
wherever solemnity, seriousness, mystery, and gloomy colours are now
found in the life of the men and of nations of the world, there is some
_survival_ of that horror which was once the universal concomitant of
all promises, pledges, and obligations. The past, the past with all
its length, depth, and hardness, wafts to us its breath, and bubbles
up in us again, when we become "serious." When man thinks it necessary
to make for himself a memory, he never accomplishes it without blood,
tortures, and sacrifice; the most dreadful sacrifices and forfeitures
(among them the sacrifice of the first-born), the most loathsome
mutilation (for instance, castration), the most cruel rituals of all
the religious cults (for all religions are really at bottom systems
of cruelty)--all these things originate from that instinct which
found in pain its most potent mnemonic. In a certain sense the whole
of asceticism is to be ascribed to this: certain ideas have got to
be made inextinguishable, omnipresent, "fixed," with the object of
hypnotising the whole nervous and intellectual system through these
"fixed ideas"--and the ascetic methods and modes of life are the means
of freeing those ideas from the competition of all other ideas so as to
make them "unforgettable." The worse memory man had, the ghastlier the
signs presented by his customs; the severity of the penal laws affords
in particular a gauge of the extent of man's difficulty in conquering
forgetfulness, and in keeping a few primal postulates of social
intercourse ever present to the minds of those who were the slaves
of every momentary emotion and every momentary desire. We Germans do
certainly not regard ourselves as an especially cruel and hard-hearted
nation, still less as an especially casual and happy-go-lucky one;
but one has only to look at our old penal ordinances in order to
realise what a lot of trouble it takes in the world to evolve a
"nation of thinkers" (I mean: _the_ European nation which exhibits at
this very day the maximum of reliability, seriousness, bad taste, and
positiveness, which has on the strength of these qualities a right to
train every kind of European mandarin). These Germans employed terrible
means to make for themselves a memory, to enable them to master their
rooted plebeian instincts and the brutal crudity of those instincts:
think of the old German punishments, for instance, stoning (as far back
as the legend, the millstone falls on the head of the guilty man),
breaking on the wheel (the most original invention and speciality of
the German genius in the sphere of punishment), dart-throwing, tearing,
or trampling by horses ("quartering"), boiling the criminal in oil or
wine (still prevalent in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries), the
highly popular flaying ("slicing into strips"), cutting the flesh out
of the breast; think also of the evil-doer being besmeared with honey,
and then exposed to the flies in a blazing sun. It was by the help of
such images and precedents that man eventually kept in his memory five
or six "I will nots" with regard to which he had already given his
_promise_, so as to be able to enjoy the advantages of society--and
verily with the help of this kind of memory man eventually attained
"reason"! Alas! reason, seriousness, mastery over the emotions, all
these gloomy, dismal things which are called reflection, all these
privileges and pageantries of humanity: how dear is the price that they
have exacted! How much blood and cruelty is the foundation of all "good
things"!

But how is it that that other melancholy object, the consciousness of
sin, the whole "bad conscience," came into the world? And it is here
that we turn back to our genealogists of morals. For the second time
I say--or have I not said it yet?--that they are worth nothing. Just
their own five-spans-long limited modern experience; no knowledge of
the past, and no wish to know it; still less a historic instinct, a
power of "second sight" (which is what is really required in this
case)--and despite this to go in for the history of morals. It stands
to reason that this must needs produce results which are removed from
the truth by something more than a respectful distance.

Have these current genealogists of morals ever allowed themselves to
have even the vaguest notion, for instance, that the cardinal moral
idea of "ought"[2] originates from the very material idea of "owe"? Or
that punishment developed as a retaliation absolutely independently
of any preliminary hypothesis of the freedom or determination of the
will?--And this to such an extent, that a high degree of civilisation
was always first necessary for the animal man to begin to make those
much more primitive distinctions of "intentional," "negligent,"
"accidental," "responsible," and their contraries, and apply them
in the assessing of punishment. That idea--"the wrong-doer deserves
punishment _because_ he might have acted otherwise," in spite of the
fact that it is nowadays so cheap, obvious, natural, and inevitable,
and that it has had to serve as an illustration of the way in which
the sentiment of justice appeared on earth, is in point of fact
an exceedingly late, and even refined form of human judgment and
inference; the placing of this idea back at the beginning of the world
is simply a clumsy violation of the principles of primitive psychology.
Throughout the longest period of human history punishment was _never_
based on the responsibility of the evil-doer for his action, and was
consequently not based on the hypothesis that only the guilty should
be punished;--on the contrary, punishment was inflicted in those days
for the same reason that parents punish their children even nowadays,
out of anger at an injury that they have suffered, an anger which vents
itself mechanically on the author of the injury--but this anger is kept
in bounds and modified through the idea that every injury has somewhere
or other its _equivalent_ price, and can really be paid off, even
though it be by means of pain to the author. Whence is it that this
ancient deep-rooted and now perhaps ineradicable idea has drawn its
strength, this idea of an equivalency between injury and pain? I have
already revealed its origin, in the contractual relationship between
_creditor_ and _ower_, that is as old as the existence of legal rights
at all, and in its turn points back to the primary forms of purchase,
sale, barter, and trade.


5.

The realisation of these contractual relations excites, of course (as
would be already expected from our previous observations), a great
deal of suspicion and opposition towards the primitive society which
made or sanctioned them. In this society promises will be made; in
this society the object is to provide the promiser with a memory;
in this society, so may we suspect, there will be full scope for
hardness, cruelty, and pain: the "ower," in order to induce credit
in his promise of repayment, in order to give a guarantee of the
earnestness and sanctity of his promise, in order to drill into his
own conscience the duty, the solemn duty, of repayment, will, by
virtue of a contract with his creditor to meet the contingency of
his not paying, pledge something that he still possesses, something
that he still has in his power, for instance, his life or his wife,
or his freedom or his body (or under certain religious conditions
even his salvation, his soul's welfare, even his peace in the grave;
so in Egypt, where the corpse of the ower found even in the grave no
rest from the creditor--of course, from the Egyptian standpoint, this
peace was a matter of particular importance). But especially has the
creditor the power of inflicting on the body of the ower all kinds of
pain and torture--the power, for instance, of cutting off from it an
amount that appeared proportionate to the greatness of the debt;--this
point of view resulted in the universal prevalence at an early date of
precise schemes of valuation, frequently horrible in the minuteness
and meticulosity of their application, _legally_ sanctioned schemes of
valuation for individual limbs and parts of the body. I consider it as
already a progress, as a proof of a freer, less petty, and more Roman
conception of law, when the Roman Code of the Twelve Tables decreed
that it was immaterial how much or how little the creditors in such a
contingency cut off, "si plus minusve secuerunt, ne fraude esto." Let
us make the logic of the whole of this equalisation process clear; it
is strange enough. The equivalence consists in this: instead of an
advantage directly compensatory of his injury (that is, instead of an
equalisation in money, lands, or some kind of chattel), the creditor
is granted by way of repayment and compensation a certain _sensation
of satisfaction_--the satisfaction of being able to vent, without any
trouble, his power on one who is powerless, the delight "_de faire le
mal pour le plaisir de le faire_," the joy in sheer violence: and this
joy will be relished in proportion to the lowness and humbleness of
the creditor in the social scale, and is quite apt to have the effect
of the most delicious dainty, and even seem the foretaste of a higher
social position. Thanks to the punishment of the "ower," the creditor
participates in the rights of the masters. At last he too, for once in
a way, attains the edifying consciousness of being able to despise and
ill-treat a creature--as an "inferior"--or at any rate of _seeing_ him
being despised and ill-treated, in case the actual power of punishment,
the administration of punishment, has already become transferred to the
"authorities." The compensation consequently consists in a claim on
cruelty and a right to draw thereon.


6.

It is then in _this_ sphere of the law of contract that we find the
cradle of the whole moral world of the ideas of "guilt," "conscience,"
"duty," the "sacredness of duty,"--their commencement, like the
commencement of all great things in the world, is thoroughly and
continuously saturated with blood. And should we not add that this
world has never really lost a certain savour of blood and torture (not
even in old Kant; the categorical imperative reeks of cruelty). It was
in this sphere likewise that there first became formed that sinister
and perhaps now indissoluble association of the ideas of "guilt" and
"suffering." To put the question yet again, why can suffering be a
compensation for "owing"?--Because the _infliction_ of suffering
produces the highest degree of happiness, because the injured party
will get in exchange for his loss (including his vexation at his loss)
an extraordinary counter-pleasure: the _infliction_ of suffering--a
real _feast_, something that, as I have said, was all the more
appreciated the greater the paradox created by the rank and social
status of the creditor. These observations are purely conjectural; for,
apart from the painful nature of the task, it is hard to plumb such
profound depths: the clumsy introduction of the idea of "revenge" as a
connecting-link simply hides and obscures the view instead of rendering
it clearer (revenge itself simply leads back again to the identical
problem--"How can the infliction of suffering be a satisfaction?").
In my opinion it is repugnant to the delicacy, and still more to the
hypocrisy of tame domestic animals (that is, modern men; that is,
ourselves), to realise with all their energy the extent to which
_cruelty_ constituted the great joy and delight of ancient man, was
an ingredient which seasoned nearly all his pleasures, and conversely
the extent of the naïveté and innocence with which he manifested his
need for cruelty, when he actually made as a matter of principle
"disinterested malice" (or, to use Spinoza's expression, the _sympathia
malevolens_) into a _normal_ characteristic of man--as consequently
something to which the conscience says a hearty yes. The more profound
observer has perhaps already had sufficient opportunity for noticing
this most ancient and radical joy and delight of mankind; in _Beyond
Good and Evil_, Aph. 188 (and even earlier, in _The Dawn of Day_, Aphs.
18, 77, 113), I have cautiously indicated the continually growing
spiritualisation and "deification" of cruelty, which pervades the
whole history of the higher civilisation (and in the larger sense even
constitutes it). At any rate the time is not so long past when it was
impossible to conceive of royal weddings and national festivals on a
grand scale, without executions, tortures, or perhaps an _auto-da-fé_",
or similarly to conceive of an aristocratic household, without a
creature to serve as a butt for the cruel and malicious baiting of the
inmates. (The reader will perhaps remember Don Quixote at the court of
the Duchess: we read nowadays the whole of _Don Quixote_ with a bitter
taste in the mouth, almost with a sensation of torture, a fact which
would appear very strange and very incomprehensible to the author and
his contemporaries--they read it with the best conscience in the world
as the gayest of books; they almost died with laughing at it.) The
sight of suffering does one good, the infliction of suffering does one
more good--this is a hard maxim, but none the less a fundamental maxim,
old, powerful, and "human, all-too-human"; one, moreover, to which
perhaps even the apes as well would subscribe: for it is said that in
inventing bizarre cruelties they are giving abundant proof of their
future humanity, to which, as it were, they are playing the prelude.
Without cruelty, no feast: so teaches the oldest and longest history of
man--and in punishment too is there so much of the festive.


7.

Entertaining, as I do, these thoughts, I am, let me say in parenthesis,
fundamentally opposed to helping our pessimists to new water for the
discordant and groaning mills of their disgust with life; on the
contrary, it should be shown specifically that, at the time when
mankind was not yet ashamed of its cruelty, life in the world was
brighter than it is nowadays when there are pessimists. The darkening
of the heavens over man has always increased in proportion to the
growth of man's shame _before man_. The tired pessimistic outlook,
the mistrust of the riddle of life, the icy negation of disgusted
ennui, all those are not the signs of the _most evil_ age of the human
race: much rather do they come first to the light of day, as the
swamp-flowers, which they are, when the swamp to which they belong,
comes into existence--I mean the diseased refinement and moralisation,
thanks to which the "animal man" has at last learnt to be ashamed of
all his instincts. On the road to angelhood (not to use in this context
a harder word) man has developed that dyspeptic stomach and coated
tongue, which have made not only the joy and innocence of the animal
repulsive to him, but also life itself:--so that sometimes he stands
with stopped nostrils before his own self, and, like Pope Innocent the
Third, makes a black list of his own horrors ("unclean generation,
loathsome nutrition when in the maternal body, badness of the matter
out of which man develops, awful stench, secretion of saliva, urine,
and excrement"). Nowadays, when suffering is always trotted out
as the first argument _against_ existence, as its most sinister
query, it is well to remember the times when men judged on converse
principles because they could not dispense with the _infliction_ of
suffering, and saw therein a magic of the first order, a veritable
bait of seduction to life.

Perhaps in those days (this is to solace the weaklings) pain did not
hurt so much as it does nowadays: any physician who has treated negroes
(granted that these are taken as representative of the prehistoric
man) suffering from severe internal inflammations which would bring
a European, even though he had the soundest constitution, almost to
despair, would be in a position to come to this conclusion. Pain has
_not_ the same effect with negroes. (The curve of human sensibilities
to pain seems indeed to sink in an extraordinary and almost sudden
fashion, as soon as one has passed the upper ten thousand or ten
millions of over-civilised humanity, and I personally have no doubt
that, by comparison with one painful night passed by one single
hysterical chit of a cultured woman, the suffering of all the animals
taken together who have been put to the question of the knife, so as
to give scientific answers, are simply negligible.) We may perhaps
be allowed to admit the possibility of the craving for cruelty not
necessarily having become really extinct: it only requires, in view
of the fact that pain hurts more nowadays, a certain sublimation and
subtilisation, it must especially be translated to the imaginative and
psychic plane, and be adorned with such smug euphemisms, that even the
most fastidious and hypocritical conscience could never grow suspicious
of their real nature ("Tragic pity" is one of these euphemisms:
another is "_les nostalgies de la croix_"). What really raises one's
indignation against suffering is not suffering intrinsically, but
the senselessness of suffering; such a _senselessness_, however,
existed neither in Christianity, which interpreted suffering into a
whole mysterious salvation-apparatus, nor in the beliefs of the naive
ancient man, who only knew how to find a meaning in suffering from
the standpoint of the spectator, or the inflictor of the suffering.
In order to get the secret, undiscovered, and unwitnessed suffering
out of the world it was almost compulsory to invent gods and a
hierarchy of intermediate beings, in short, something which wanders
even among secret places, sees even in the dark, and makes a point
of never missing an interesting and painful spectacle. It was with
the help of such inventions that life got to learn the _tour de
force_, which has become part of its stock-in-trade, the _tour de
force_ of self-justification, of the justification of evil; nowadays
this would perhaps require other auxiliary devices (for instance,
life as a riddle, life as a problem of knowledge). "Every evil is
justified in the sight of which a god finds edification," so rang the
logic of primitive sentiment--and, indeed, was it only of primitive?
The gods conceived as friends of spectacles of cruelty--oh how far
does this primeval conception extend even nowadays into our European
civilisation! One would perhaps like in this context to consult Luther
and Calvin. It is at any rate certain that even the Greeks knew no
more piquant seasoning for the happiness of their gods than the joys
of cruelty. What, do you think, was the mood with which Homer makes
his gods look down upon the fates of men? What final meaning have at
bottom the Trojan War and similar tragic horrors? It is impossible to
entertain any doubt on the point: they were intended as festival games
for the gods, and, in so far as the poet is of a more godlike breed
than other men, as festival games also for the poets. It was in just
this spirit and no other, that at a later date the moral philosophers
of Greece conceived the eyes of God as still looking down on the moral
struggle, the heroism, and the self-torture of the virtuous; the
Heracles of duty was on a stage, and was conscious of the fact; virtue
without witnesses was something quite unthinkable for this nation of
actors. Must not that philosophic invention, so audacious and so fatal,
which was then absolutely new to Europe, the invention of "free will,"
of the absolute spontaneity of man in good and evil, simply have been
made for the specific purpose of justifying the idea, that the interest
of the gods in humanity and human virtue was _inexhaustible_?

There would never on the stage of this free-will world be a dearth of
really new, really novel and exciting situations, plots, catastrophes.
A world thought out on completely deterministic lines would be easily
guessed by the gods, and would consequently soon bore them--sufficient
reason for these _friends of the gods_, the philosophers, not to
ascribe to their gods such a deterministic world. The whole of ancient
humanity is full of delicate consideration for the spectator, being as
it is a world of thorough publicity and theatricality, which could not
conceive of happiness without spectacles and festivals.--And, as has
already been said, even in great punishment there is so much which is
festive.

The feeling of "ought," of personal obligation (to take up again
the train of our inquiry), has had, as we saw, its origin in the
oldest and most original personal relationship that there is, the
relationship between buyer and seller, creditor and ower: here it
was that individual confronted individual, and that individual
_matched himself against_ individual. There has not yet been found
a grade of civilisation so low, as not to manifest some trace of
this relationship. Making prices, assessing values, thinking out
equivalents, exchanging--all this preoccupied the primal thoughts
of man to such an extent that in a certain sense it constituted
_thinking_ itself: it was here that was trained the oldest form of
sagacity, it was here in this sphere that we can perhaps trace the
first commencement of man's pride, of his feeling of superiority over
other animals. Perhaps our word "Mensch" (_manas_) still expresses
just something of _this_ self-pride: man denoted himself as the being
who measures values, who values and measures, as the "assessing"
animal _par excellence_. Sale and purchase, together with their
psychological concomitants, are older than the origins of any form of
social organisation and union: it is rather from the most rudimentary
form of individual right that the budding consciousness of exchange,
commerce, debt, right, obligation, compensation was first transferred
to the rudest and most elementary of the social complexes (in their
relation to similar complexes), the habit of comparing force with
force, together with that of measuring, of calculating. His eye was
now focussed to this perspective; and with that ponderous consistency
characteristic of ancient thought, which, though set in motion with
difficulty, yet proceeds inflexibly along the line on which it has
started, man soon arrived at the great generalisation, "everything has
its price, _all_ can be paid for," the oldest and most naive moral
canon of _justice_, the beginning of all "kindness," of all "equity,"
of all "goodwill," of all "objectivity" in the world. Justice in this
initial phase is the goodwill among people of about equal power to come
to terms with each other, to come to an understanding again by means of
a settlement, and with regard to the less powerful, to _compel_ them
to agree among themselves to a settlement.

Measured always by the standard of antiquity (this antiquity, moreover,
is present or again possible at all periods), the community stands to
its members in that important and radical relationship of creditor to
his "owers." Man lives in a community, man enjoys the advantages of
a community (and what advantages! we occasionally underestimate them
nowadays), man lives protected, spared, in peace and trust, secure
from certain injuries and enmities, to which the man outside the
community, the "peaceless" man, is exposed,--a German understands the
original meaning of "Elend" (_êlend_),--secure because he has entered
into pledges and obligations to the community in respect of these very
injuries and enmities. What happens _when this is not the case_? The
community, the defrauded creditor, will get itself paid, as well as it
can, one can reckon on that. In this case the question of the direct
damage done by the offender is quite subsidiary: quite apart from
this the criminal[3] is above all a breaker, a breaker of word and
covenant _to the whole_, as regards all the advantages and amenities
of the communal life in which up to that time he had participated. The
criminal is an "ower" who not only fails to repay the advances and
advantages that have been given to him, but even sets out to attack
his creditor: consequently he is in the future not only, as is fair,
deprived of all these advantages and amenities--he is in addition
reminded of the _importance_ of those advantages. The wrath of the
injured creditor, of the community, puts him back in the wild and
outlawed status from which he was previously protected: the community
repudiates him--and now every kind of enmity can vent itself on him.
Punishment is in this stage of civilisation simply the copy, the mimic,
of the normal treatment of the hated, disdained, and conquered enemy,
who is not only deprived of every right and protection but of every
mercy; so we have the martial law and triumphant festival of the _væ
victis_! in all its mercilessness and cruelty. This shows why war
itself (counting the sacrificial cult of war) has produced all the
forms under which punishment has manifested itself in history.


10.

As it grows more powerful, the community tends to take the offences of
the individual less seriously, because they are now regarded as being
much less revolutionary and dangerous to the corporate existence: the
evil-doer is no more outlawed and put outside the pale, the common
wrath can no longer vent itself upon him with its old licence,--on
the contrary, from this very time it is against this wrath, and
particularly against the wrath of those directly injured, that the
evil-doer is carefully shielded and protected by the community. As, in
fact, the penal law develops, the following characteristics become
more and more clearly marked: compromise with the wrath of those
directly affected by the misdeed; a consequent endeavour to localise
the matter and to prevent a further, or indeed a general spread of
the disturbance; attempts to find equivalents and to settle the whole
matter (compositio); above all, the will, which manifests itself with
increasing definiteness, to treat every offence as in a certain degree
capable of _being paid off_, and consequently, at any rate up to a
certain point, to _isolate_ the offender from his act. As the power and
the self-consciousness of a community increases, so proportionately
does the penal law become mitigated; conversely every weakening and
jeopardising of the community revives the harshest forms of that law.
The creditor has always grown more humane proportionately as he has
grown more rich; finally the amount of injury he can endure without
really suffering becomes the criterion of his wealth. It is possible
to conceive of a society blessed with so great a _consciousness of its
own power_ as to indulge in the most aristocratic luxury of letting
its wrong-doers go _scot-free_.--"What do my parasites matter to me?"
might society say. "Let them live and flourish! I am strong enough for
it."--The justice which began with the maxim, "Everything can be paid
off, everything must be paid off," ends with connivance at the escape
of those who cannot pay to escape--it ends, like every good thing on
earth, by _destroying itself_.--The self-destruction of Justice! we
know the pretty name it calls itself--_Grace!_ it remains, as is
obvious, the privilege of the strongest, better still, their super-law.


11.

A deprecatory word here against the attempts, that have lately been
made, to find the origin of justice on quite another basis--namely,
on that of _resentment_. Let me whisper a word in the ear of the
psychologists, if they would fain study revenge itself at close
quarters: this plant blooms its prettiest at present among Anarchists
and anti-Semites, a hidden flower, as it has ever been, like the
violet, though, forsooth, with another perfume. And as like must
necessarily emanate from like, it will not be a matter for surprise
that it is just in such circles that we see the birth of endeavours (it
is their old birthplace--compare above, First Essay, paragraph 14),
to sanctify _revenge_ under the name of _justice_ (as though Justice
were at bottom merely a _development_ of the consciousness of injury),
and thus with the rehabilitation of revenge to reinstate generally
and collectively all the _reactive_ emotions. I object to this last
point least of all. It even seems _meritorious_ when regarded from the
standpoint of the whole problem of biology (from which standpoint the
value of these emotions has up to the present been underestimated).
And that to which I alone call attention, is the circumstance that
it is the spirit of revenge itself, from which develops this new
nuance of scientific equity (for the benefit of hate, envy, mistrust,
jealousy, suspicion, rancour, revenge). This scientific "equity"
stops immediately and makes way for the accents of deadly enmity and
prejudice, so soon as another group of emotions comes on the scene,
which in my opinion are of a much higher biological value than these
reactions, and consequently have a paramount claim to the valuation
and appreciation of science: I mean the really _active_ emotions, such
as personal and material ambition, and so forth. (E. Dühring, _Value
of Life; Course of Philosophy_, and _passim_.) So much against this
tendency in general: but as for the particular maxim of Dühring's,
that the home of Justice is to be found in the sphere of the reactive
feelings, our love of truth compels us drastically to invert his own
proposition and to oppose to him this other maxim: the _last_ sphere
conquered by the spirit of justice is the sphere of the feeling of
reaction! When it really comes about that the just man remains just
even as regards his injurer (and not merely cold, moderate, reserved,
indifferent: being just is always a _positive_ state); when, in spite
of the strong provocation of personal insult, contempt, and calumny,
the lofty and clear objectivity of the just and judging eye (whose
glance is as profound as it is gentle) is untroubled, why then we have
a piece of perfection, a past master of the world--something, in fact,
which it would not be wise to expect, and which should not at any
rate be too easily _believed_. Speaking generally, there is no doubt
but that even the justest individual only requires a little dose of
hostility, malice, or innuendo to drive the blood into his brain and
the fairness _from_ it. The active man, the attacking, aggressive man
is always a hundred degrees nearer to justice than the man who merely
reacts; he certainly has no need to adopt the tactics, necessary in the
case of the reacting man, of making false and biassed valuations of his
object. It is, in point of fact, for this reason that the aggressive
man has at all times enjoyed the stronger, bolder, more aristocratic,
and also _freer_ outlook, the _better_ conscience. On the other hand,
we already surmise who it really is that has on his conscience the
invention of the "bad conscience,"--the resentful man! Finally, let man
look at himself in history. In what sphere up to the present has the
whole administration of law, the actual need of law, found its earthly
home? Perchance in the sphere of the reacting man? Not for a minute:
rather in that of the active, strong, spontaneous, aggressive man? I
deliberately defy the above-mentioned agitator (who himself makes this
self-confession, "the creed of revenge has run through all my works
and endeavours like the red thread of Justice"), and say, that judged
historically law in the world represents the very war _against_ the
reactive feelings, the very war waged on those feelings by the powers
of activity and aggression, which devote some of their strength to
damming and keeping within bounds this effervescence of hysterical
reactivity, and to forcing it to some compromise. Everywhere where
justice is practised and justice is maintained, it is to be observed
that the stronger power, when confronted with the weaker powers which
are inferior to it (whether they be groups, or individuals), searches
for weapons to put an end to the senseless fury of resentment, while
it carries on its object, partly by taking the victim of resentment
out of the clutches of revenge, partly by substituting for revenge a
campaign of its own against the enemies of peace and order, partly
by finding, suggesting, and occasionally enforcing settlements,
partly by standardising certain equivalents for injuries, to which
equivalents the element of resentment is henceforth finally referred.
The most drastic measure, however, taken and effectuated by the supreme
power, to combat the preponderance of the feelings of spite and
vindictiveness--it takes this measure as soon as it is at all strong
enough to do so--is the foundation of _law_, the imperative declaration
of what in its eyes is to be regarded as just and lawful, and what
unjust and unlawful: and while, after the foundation of law, the
supreme power treats the aggressive and arbitrary acts of individuals,
or of whole groups, as a violation of law, and a revolt against
itself, it distracts the feelings of its subjects from the immediate
injury inflicted by such a violation, and thus eventually attains the
very opposite result to that always desired by revenge, which sees
and recognises nothing but the standpoint of the injured party. From
henceforth the eye becomes trained to a more and more _impersonal_
valuation of the deed, even the eye of the injured party himself
(though this is in the final stage of all, as has been previously
remarked)--on this principle "right" and "wrong" first manifest
themselves after the foundation of law (and not, as Dühring maintains,
only after the act of violation). To talk of intrinsic right and
intrinsic wrong is absolutely non-sensical; intrinsically, an injury,
an oppression, an exploitation, an annihilation can be nothing wrong,
inasmuch as life is _essentially_ (that is, in its cardinal functions)
something which functions by injuring, oppressing, exploiting, and
annihilating, and is absolutely inconceivable without such a character.
It is necessary to make an even more serious confession:--viewed from
the most advanced biological standpoint, conditions of legality can be
only _exceptional conditions_, in that they are partial restrictions
of the real life-will, which makes for power, and in that they are
subordinated to the life-will's general end as particular means,
that is, as means to create _larger_ units of strength. A legal
organisation, conceived of as sovereign and universal, not as a weapon
in a fight of complexes of power, but as a weapon _against_ fighting,
generally something after the style of Dühring's communistic model
of treating every will as equal with every other will, would be a
principle _hostile to life_, a destroyer and dissolver of man, an
outrage on the future of man, a symptom of fatigue, a secret cut to
Nothingness.--


12.

A word more on the origin and end of punishment--two problems which
are or ought to be kept distinct, but which unfortunately are usually
lumped into one. And what tactics have our moral genealogists employed
up to the present in these cases? Their inveterate naïveté. They find
out some "end" in the punishment, for instance, revenge and deterrence,
and then in all their innocence set this end at the beginning, as the
_causa fiendi_ of the punishment, and--they have done the trick. But
the patching up of a history of the origin of law is the last use to
which the "End in Law"[4] ought to be put. Perhaps there is no more
pregnant principle for any kind of history than the following, which,
difficult though it is to master, _should_ none the less be _mastered_
in every detail.--The origin of the existence of a thing and its final
utility, its practical application and incorporation in a system of
ends, are _toto cœlo_ opposed to each other--everything, anything,
which exists and which prevails anywhere, will always be put to new
purposes by a force superior to itself, will be commandeered afresh,
will be turned and transformed to new uses; all "happening" in the
organic world consists of _overpowering_ and dominating, and again all
overpowering and domination is a new interpretation and adjustment,
which must necessarily obscure or absolutely extinguish the subsisting
"meaning" and "end." The most perfect comprehension of the utility
of any physiological organ (or also of a legal institution, social
custom, political habit, form in art or in religious worship) does not
for a minute imply any simultaneous comprehension of its origin: this
may seem uncomfortable and unpalatable to the older men,--for it has
been the immemorial belief that understanding the final cause or the
utility of a thing, a form, an institution, means also understanding
the reason for its origin: to give an example of this logic, the eye
was made to see, the hand was made to grasp. So even punishment was
conceived as invented with a view to punishing. But all ends and all
utilities are only _signs_ that a Will to Power has mastered a less
powerful force, has impressed thereon out of its own self the meaning
of a function; and the whole history of a "Thing," an organ, a custom,
can on the same principle be regarded as a continuous "sign-chain"
of perpetually new interpretations and adjustments, whose causes, so
far from needing to have even a mutual connection, sometimes follow
and alternate with each other absolutely haphazard. Similarly, the
evolution of a "thing," of a custom, is anything but its _progressus_
to an end, still less a logical and direct _progressus_ attained
with the minimum expenditure of energy and cost: it is rather the
succession of processes of subjugation, more or less profound, more
or less mutually independent, which operate on the thing itself; it
is, further, the resistance which in each case invariably displayed
this subjugation, the Protean wriggles by way of defence and reaction,
and, further, the results of successful counter-efforts. The form is
fluid, but the meaning is even more so--even inside every individual
organism the case is the same: with every genuine growth of the whole,
the "function" of the individual organs becomes shifted,--in certain
cases a partial perishing of these organs, a diminution of their
numbers (for instance, through annihilation of the connecting members),
can be a symptom of growing strength and perfection. What I mean is
this: even partial _loss of utility_, decay, and degeneration, loss of
function and purpose, in a word, death, appertain to the conditions
of the genuine _progressus_; which always appears in the shape of
a will and way to _greater_ power, and is always realised at the
expense of innumerable smaller powers. The magnitude of a "progress"
is gauged by the greatness of the sacrifice that it requires: humanity
as a mass sacrificed to the prosperity of the one _stronger_ species
of Man--that _would be_ a progress. I emphasise all the more this
cardinal characteristic of the historic method, for the reason that in
its essence it runs counter to predominant instincts and prevailing
taste, which much prefer to put up with absolute casualness, even with
the mechanical senselessness of all phenomena, than with the theory
of a power-will, in exhaustive play throughout all phenomena. The
democratic idiosyncrasy against everything which rules and wishes to
rule, the modern _misarchism_ (to coin a bad word for a bad thing),
has gradually but so thoroughly transformed itself into the guise of
intellectualism, the most abstract intellectualism, that even nowadays
it penetrates and _has the right_ to penetrate step by step into the
most exact and apparently the most objective sciences: this tendency
has, in fact, in my view already dominated the whole of physiology
and biology, and to their detriment, as is obvious, in so far as
it has spirited away a radical idea, the idea of true _activity_.
The tyranny of this idiosyncrasy, however, results in the theory
of "adaptation" being pushed forward into the van of the argument,
exploited; adaptation--that means to say, a second-class activity, a
mere capacity for "reacting"; in fact, life itself has been defined
(by Herbert Spencer) as an increasingly effective internal adaptation
to external circumstances. This definition, however, fails to realise
the real essence of life, its will to power. It fails to appreciate the
paramount superiority enjoyed by those plastic forces of spontaneity,
aggression, and encroachment with their new interpretations and
tendencies, to the operation of which adaptation is only a natural
corollary: consequently the sovereign office of the highest
functionaries in the organism itself (among which the life-will appears
as an active and formative principle) is repudiated. One remembers
Huxley's reproach to Spencer of his "administrative Nihilism": but it
is a case of something much _more_ than "administration."


13.

To return to our subject, namely _punishment_, we must make
consequently a double distinction: first, the relatively permanent
_element_, the custom, the act, the "drama," a certain rigid sequence
of methods of procedure; on the other hand, the fluid element, the
meaning, the end, the expectation which is attached to the operation of
such procedure. At this point we immediately assume, _per analogiam_
(in accordance with the theory of the historic method, which we have
elaborated above), that the procedure itself is something older and
earlier than its utilisation in punishment, that this utilisation was
_introduced_ and interpreted into the procedure (which had existed
for a long time, but whose employment had another meaning), in short,
that the case is _different_ from that hitherto supposed by our _naïf_
genealogists of morals and of law, who thought that the procedure was
_invented_ for the purpose of punishment, in the same way that the hand
had been previously thought to have been invented for the purpose of
grasping. With regard to the other element in _punishment_, its fluid
element, its meaning, the idea of punishment in a very late stage of
civilisation (for instance, contemporary Europe) is not content with
manifesting merely one meaning, but manifests a whole synthesis "of
meanings." The past general history of punishment, the history of its
employment for the most diverse ends, crystallises eventually into
a kind of unity, which is difficult to analyse into its parts, and
which, it is necessary to emphasise, absolutely defies definition.
(It is nowadays impossible to say definitely _the precise reason_
for punishment: all ideas, in which a whole process is promiscuously
comprehended, elude definition; it is only that which has no history,
which can be defined.) At an earlier stage, on the contrary, that
synthesis of meanings appears much less rigid and much more elastic; we
can realise how in each individual case the elements of the synthesis
change their value and their position, so that now one element and
now another stands out and predominates over the others, nay, in
certain cases one element (perhaps the end of deterrence) seems to
eliminate all the rest. At any rate, so as to give some idea of the
uncertain, supplementary, and accidental nature of the meaning of
punishment and of the manner in which one identical procedure can
be employed and adapted for the most diametrically opposed objects,
I will at this point give a scheme that has suggested itself to
me, a scheme itself based on comparatively small and accidental
material.--Punishment, as rendering the criminal harmless and incapable
of further injury.--Punishment, as compensation for the injury
sustained by the injured party, in any form whatsoever (including
the form of sentimental compensation).--Punishment, as an isolation
of that which disturbs the equilibrium, so as to prevent the further
spreading of the disturbance.--Punishment as a means of inspiring
fear of those who determine and execute the punishment.--Punishment
as a kind of compensation for advantages which the wrong-doer has
up to that time enjoyed (for example, when he is utilised as a
slave in the mines).--Punishment, as the elimination of an element
of decay (sometimes of a whole branch, as according to the Chinese
laws, consequently as a means to the purification of the race, or
the preservation of a social type).---Punishment as a festival, as
the violent oppression and humiliation of an enemy that has at last
been subdued.--Punishment as a mnemonic, whether for him who suffers
the punishment--the so-called "correction," or for the witnesses of
its administration. Punishment, as the payment of a fee stipulated
for by the power which protects the evil-doer from the excesses of
revenge.--Punishment, as a compromise with the natural phenomenon
of revenge, in so far as revenge is still maintained and claimed
as a privilege by the stronger races.--Punishment as a declaration
and measure of war against an enemy of peace, of law, of order,
of authority, who is fought by society with the weapons which war
provides, as a spirit dangerous to the community, as a breaker of the
contract on which the community is based, as a rebel, a traitor, and a
breaker of the peace.


14.

This list is certainly not complete; it is obvious that punishment
is overloaded with utilities of all kinds. This makes it all the
more permissible to eliminate one supposed utility, which passes, at
any rate in the popular mind, for its most essential utility, and
which is just what even now provides the strongest support for that
faith in punishment which is nowadays for many reasons tottering.
Punishment is supposed to have the value of exciting in the guilty
the consciousness of guilt; in punishment is sought the proper
instrumentum of that psychic reaction which becomes known as a "bad
conscience," "remorse." But this theory is even, from the point of
view of the present, a violation of reality and psychology: and how
much more so is the case when we have to deal with the longest period
of man's history, his primitive history! Genuine remorse is certainly
extremely rare among wrong-doers and the victims of punishment; prisons
and houses of correction are not _the_ soil on which this worm of
remorse pullulates for choice--this is the unanimous opinion of all
conscientious observers, who in many cases arrive at such a judgment
with enough reluctance and against their own personal wishes. Speaking
generally, punishment hardens and numbs, it produces concentration, it
sharpens the consciousness of alienation, it strengthens the power of
resistance. When it happens that it breaks the man's energy and brings
about a piteous prostration and abjectness, such a result is certainly
even less salutary than the average effect of punishment, which is
characterised by a harsh and sinister doggedness. The thought of those
_prehistoric_ millennia brings us to the unhesitating conclusion,
that it was simply through punishment that the evolution of the
consciousness of guilt was most forcibly retarded--at any rate in the
victims of the punishing power. In particular, let us not underestimate
the extent to which, by the very sight of the judicial and executive
procedure, the wrong-doer is himself prevented from feeling that his
deed, the character of his act, is _intrinsically_ reprehensible: for
he sees clearly the same kind of acts practised in the service of
justice, and then called good, and practised with a good conscience;
acts such as espionage, trickery, bribery, trapping, the whole
intriguing and insidious art of the policeman and the informer--the
whole system, in fact, manifested in the different kinds of punishment
(a system not excused by passion, but based on principle), of robbing,
oppressing, insulting, imprisoning, racking, murdering.--All this
he sees treated by his judges, not as acts meriting censure and
condemnation _in themselves_, but only in a particular context and
application. It was not on this soil that grew the "bad conscience,"
that most sinister and interesting plant of our earthly vegetation--
in point of fact, throughout a most lengthy period, no suggestion of
having to do with a "guilty man" manifested itself in the consciousness
of the man who judged and punished. One had merely to deal with an
author of an injury, an irresponsible piece of fate. And the man
himself, on whom the punishment subsequently fell like a piece of fate,
was occasioned no more of an "inner pain" than would be occasioned by
the sudden approach of some uncalculated event, some terrible natural
catastrophe, a rushing, crushing avalanche against which there is no
resistance.


15.

This truth came insidiously enough to the consciousness of Spinoza (to
the disgust of his commentators, who (like Kuno Fischer, for instance)
give themselves no end of _trouble_ to misunderstand him on this
point), when one afternoon (as he sat raking up who knows what memory)
he indulged in the question of what was really left for him personally
of the celebrated _morsus conscientiæ_--Spinoza, who had relegated
"good and evil" to the sphere of human imagination, and indignantly
defended the honour of his "free" God against those blasphemers who
affirmed that God did everything _sub ratione boni_ ("but this was
tantamount to subordinating God to fate, and would really be the
greatest of all absurdities"). For Spinoza the world had returned
again to that innocence in which it lay before the discovery of the
bad conscience: what, then, had happened to the _morsus conscientiæ_?
"The antithesis of _gaudium_," said he at last to himself,--"A sadness
accompanied by the recollection of a past event which has turned out
contrary to all expectation" (_Eth_. III., Propos. XVIII. Schol.
i. ii.). Evil-doers have throughout thousands of years felt when
overtaken by punishment _exactly like Spinoza_, on the subject of
their "offence": "here is something which went wrong contrary to my
anticipation," not "I ought not to have done this."--They submitted
themselves to punishment, just as one submits one's self to a disease,
to a misfortune, or to death, with that stubborn and resigned fatalism
which gives the Russians, for instance, even nowadays, the advantage
over us Westerners, in the handling of life. If at that period there
was a critique of action, the criterion was prudence: the real _effect_
of punishment is unquestionably chiefly to be found in a sharpening
of the sense of prudence, in a lengthening of the memory, in a will
to adopt more of a policy of caution, suspicion, and secrecy; in the
recognition that there are many things which are unquestionably beyond
one's capacity; in a kind of improvement in self-criticism. The broad
effects which can be obtained by punishment in man and beast, are the
increase of fear, the sharpening of the sense of cunning, the mastery
of the desires: so it is that punishment _tames_ man, but does not make
him "better"--it would be more correct even to go so far as to assert
the contrary ("Injury makes a man cunning," says a popular proverb: so
far as it makes him cunning, it makes him also bad. Fortunately, it
often enough makes him stupid).


16.

At this juncture I cannot avoid trying to give a tentative and
provisional expression to my own hypothesis concerning the origin of
the bad conscience: it is difficult to make it fully appreciated,
and it requires continuous meditation, attention, and digestion. I
regard the bad conscience as the serious illness which man was bound
to contract under the stress of the most radical change which he has
ever experienced--that change, when he found himself finally imprisoned
within the pale of society and of peace.

Just like the plight of the water-animals, when they were compelled
either to become land-animals or to perish, so was the plight of these
half-animals, perfectly adapted as they were to the savage life of war,
prowling, and adventure--suddenly all their instincts were rendered
worthless and "switched off." Henceforward they had to walk on their
feet--"carry themselves," whereas heretofore they had been carried by
the water: a terrible heaviness oppressed them. They found themselves
clumsy in obeying the simplest directions, confronted with this new
and unknown world they had no longer their old guides--the regulative
instincts that had led them unconsciously to safety--they were reduced,
were those unhappy creatures, to thinking, inferring, calculating,
putting together causes and results, reduced to that poorest and most
erratic organ of theirs, their "consciousness." I do not believe
there was ever in the world such a feeling of misery, such a leaden
discomfort--further, those old instincts had not immediately ceased
their demands! Only it was difficult and rarely possible to gratify
them: speaking broadly, they were compelled to satisfy themselves by
new and, as it were, hole-and-corner methods. All instincts which
do not find a vent without, _turn inwards_--this is what I mean by
the growing "internalisation" of man: consequently we have the first
growth in man, of what subsequently was called his soul. The whole
inner world, originally as thin as if it had been stretched between
two layers of skin, burst apart and expanded proportionately, and
obtained depth, breadth, and height, when man's external outlet
became _obstructed_. These terrible bulwarks, with which the social
organisation protected itself against the old instincts of freedom
(punishments belong pre-eminently to these bulwarks), brought it
about that all those instincts of wild, free, prowling man became
turned backwards against man himself. Enmity, cruelty, the delight
in persecution, in surprises, change, destruction--the turning all
these instincts against their own possessors: this is the origin of
the "bad conscience." It was man, who, lacking external enemies and
obstacles, and imprisoned as he was in the oppressive narrowness and
monotony of custom, in his own impatience lacerated, persecuted,
gnawed, frightened, and ill-treated himself; it was this animal in the
hands of the tamer, which beat itself against the bars of its cage; it
was this being who, pining and yearning for that desert home of which
it had been deprived, was compelled to create out of its own self, an
adventure, a torture-chamber, a hazardous and perilous desert--it was
this fool, this homesick and desperate prisoner--who invented the "bad
conscience." But thereby he introduced that most grave and sinister
illness, from which mankind has not yet recovered, the suffering of
man from the disease called man, as the result of a violent breaking
from his animal past, the result, as it were, of a spasmodic plunge
into a new environment and new conditions of existence, the result of
a declaration of war against the old instincts, which up to that time
had been the staple of his power, his joy, his formidableness. Let
us immediately add that this fact of an animal ego turning against
itself, taking part against itself, produced in the world so novel,
profound, unheard-of, problematic, inconsistent, and _pregnant_ a
phenomenon, that the aspect of the world was radically altered thereby.
In sooth, only divine spectators could have appreciated the drama
that then began, and whose end baffles conjecture as yet--a drama too
subtle, too wonderful, too paradoxical to warrant its undergoing a
non-sensical and unheeded performance on some random grotesque planet!
Henceforth man is to be counted as one of the most unexpected and
sensational lucky shots in the game of the "big baby" of Heracleitus,
whether he be called Zeus or Chance--he awakens on his behalf the
interest, excitement, hope, almost the confidence, of his being the
harbinger and forerunner of something, of man being no end, but only a
stage, an interlude, a bridge, a great promise.


17.

It is primarily involved in this hypothesis of the origin of the bad
conscience, that that alteration was no gradual and no voluntary
alteration, and that it did not manifest itself as an organic
adaptation to new conditions, but as a break, a jump, a necessity, an
inevitable fate, against which there was no resistance and never a
spark of resentment. And secondarily, that the fitting of a hitherto
unchecked and amorphous population into a fixed form, starting as
it had done in an act of violence, could only be accomplished by
acts of violence and nothing else--that the oldest "State" appeared
consequently as a ghastly tyranny, a grinding ruthless piece of
machinery, which went on working, till this raw material of a
semi-animal populace was not only thoroughly kneaded and elastic, but
also _moulded_. I used the word "State": my meaning is self-evident,
namely, a herd of blonde beasts of prey, a race of conquerors and
masters, which with all its warlike organisation and all its organising
power pounces with its terrible claws on a population, in numbers
possibly tremendously superior, but as yet formless, as yet nomad.
Such is the origin of the "State." That fantastic theory that makes it
begin with a contract is, I think, disposed of. He who can command,
he who is a master by "nature," he who comes on the scene forceful
in deed and gesture--what has he to do with contracts? Such beings
defy calculation, they come like fate, without cause, reason, notice,
excuse, they are there like the lightning is there, too terrible, too
sudden, too convincing, too "different," to be personally even hated.
Their work is an instinctive creating and impressing of forms, they
are the most involuntary, unconscious artists that there are:--their
appearance produces instantaneously a scheme of sovereignty which is
live, in which the functions are partitioned and apportioned, in which
above all no part is received or finds a place, until pregnant with
a "meaning" in regard to the whole. They are ignorant of the meaning
of guilt, responsibility, consideration, are these born organisers;
in them predominates that terrible artist-egoism, that gleams like
brass, and that knows itself justified to all eternity, in its work,
even as a mother in her child. It is not in _them_ that there grew
the bad conscience, that is elementary--but it would not have grown
_without_ them, repulsive growth as it was, it would be missing, had
not a tremendous quantity of freedom been expelled from the world by
the stress of their hammer-strokes, their artist violence, or been at
any rate made invisible and, as it were, _latent_. This _instinct of
freedom_ forced into being latent--it is already clear--this instinct
of freedom forced back, trodden back, imprisoned within itself, and
finally only able to find vent and relief in itself; this, only this,
is the beginning of the "bad conscience."


18.

Beware of thinking lightly of this phenomenon, by reason of its initial
painful ugliness. At bottom it is the same active force which is at
work on a more grandiose scale in those potent artists and organisers,
and builds states, which here, internally, on a smaller and pettier
scale and with a retrogressive tendency, makes itself a bad science in
the "labyrinth of the breast," to use Goethe's phrase, and which builds
negative ideals; it is, I repeat, that identical _instinct of freedom_
(to use my own language, the will to power): only the material, on
which this force with all its constructive and tyrannous nature is
let loose, is here man himself, his whole old animal self--and not as
in the case of that more grandiose and sensational phenomenon, the
_other_ man, _other_ men. This secret self-tyranny, this cruelty of
the artist, this delight in giving a form to one's self as a piece of
difficult, refractory, and suffering material, in burning in a will, a
critique, a contradiction, a contempt, a negation; this sinister and
ghastly labour of love on the part of a soul, whose will is cloven
in two within itself, which makes itself suffer from delight in the
infliction of suffering; this wholly _active_ bad conscience has
finally (as one already anticipates)--true fountainhead as it is of
idealism and imagination--produced an abundance of novel and amazing
beauty and affirmation, and perhaps has really been the first to
give birth to beauty at all. What would beauty be, forsooth, if its
contradiction had not first been presented to consciousness, if the
ugly had not first said to itself, "I am ugly"? At any rate, after this
hint the problem of how far idealism and beauty can be traced in such
opposite ideas as "_selflessness_," _self-denial_, _self-sacrifice_,
becomes less problematical; and indubitably in future we shall
certainly know the real and original character of the _delight_
experienced by the self-less, the self-denying, the self-sacrificing:
this delight is a phase of cruelty.--So much provisionally for the
origin of "altruism" as a _moral_ value, and the marking out the ground
from which this value has grown: it is only the bad conscience, only
the will for self-abuse, that provides the necessary conditions for the
existence of altruism as a _value_.


19.

Undoubtedly the bad conscience is an illness, but an illness like
pregnancy is an illness. If we search out the conditions under which
this illness reaches its most terrible and sublime zenith, we shall see
what really first brought about its entry into the world. But to do
this we must take a long breath, and we must first of all go back once
again to an earlier point of view. The relation at civil law of the
ower to his creditor (which has already been discussed in detail), has
been interpreted once again (and indeed in a manner which historically
is exceedingly remarkable and suspicious) into a relationship, which
is perhaps more incomprehensible to us moderns than to any other era;
that is, into the relationship of the _existing_ generation to its
_ancestors_. Within the original tribal association--we are talking of
primitive times--each living generation recognises a legal obligation
towards the earlier generation, and particularly towards the earliest,
which founded the family (and this is something much more than a mere
sentimental obligation, the existence of which, during the longest
period of man's history, is by no means indisputable). There prevails
in them the conviction that it is only thanks to sacrifices and efforts
of their ancestors, that the race _persists_ at all--and that this
has to be _paid back_ to them by sacrifices and services. Thus is
recognised the _owing_ of a debt, which accumulates continually by
reason of these ancestors never ceasing in their subsequent life as
potent spirits to secure by their power new privileges and advantages
to the race. Gratis, perchance? But there is no gratis for that raw
and "mean-souled" age. What return can be made?--Sacrifice (at first,
nourishment, in its crudest sense), festivals, temples, tributes of
veneration, above all, obedience--since all customs are, _quâ_ works of
the ancestors, equally their precepts and commands--are the ancestors
ever given enough? This suspicion remains and grows: from time to time
it extorts a great wholesale ransom, something monstrous in the way of
repayment of the creditor (the notorious sacrifice of the first-born,
for example, blood, human blood in any case). The _fear_ of ancestors
and their power, the consciousness of owing debts to them, necessarily
increases, according to this kind of logic, in the exact proportion
that the race itself increases, that the race itself becomes more
victorious, more independent, more honoured, more feared. This, and not
the contrary, is the fact. Each step towards race decay, all disastrous
events, all symptoms of degeneration, of approaching disintegration,
always _diminish_ the fear of the founders' spirit, and whittle away
the idea of his sagacity, providence, and potent presence. Conceive
this crude kind of logic carried to its climax: it follows that the
ancestors of the _most powerful_ races must, through the growing fear
that they exercise on the imaginations, grow themselves into monstrous
dimensions, and become relegated to the gloom of a divine mystery that
transcends imagination--the ancestor becomes at last necessarily
transfigured into a _god_. Perhaps this is the very origin of the gods,
that is, an origin from _fear_! And those who feel bound to add, "but
from piety also," will have difficulty in maintaining this theory,
with regard to the primeval and longest period of the human race. And
of course this is even more the case as regards the _middle_ period,
the formative period of the aristocratic races--the aristocratic
races which have given back with interest to their founders, the
ancestors (heroes, gods), all those qualities which in the meanwhile
have appeared in themselves, that is, the aristocratic qualities. We
will later on glance again at the ennobling and promotion of the gods
(which of course is totally distinct from their "sanctification"): let
us now provisionally follow to its end the course of the whole of this
development of the consciousness of "owing."


20.

According to the teaching of history, the consciousness of owing
debts to the deity by no means came to an end with the decay of the
clan organisation of society; just as mankind has inherited the
ideas of "good" and "bad" from the race-nobility (together with its
fundamental tendency towards establishing social distinctions), so
with the heritage of the racial and tribal gods it has also inherited
the incubus of debts as yet unpaid and the desire to discharge them.
The transition is effected by those large populations of slaves and
bondsmen, who, whether through compulsion or through submission and
"_mimicry,_" have accommodated themselves to the religion of their
masters; through this channel these inherited tendencies inundate
the world. The feeling of owing a debt to the deity has grown
continuously for several centuries, always in the same proportion in
which the idea of God and the consciousness of God have grown and
become exalted among mankind. (The whole history of ethnic fights,
victories, reconciliations, amalgamations, everything, in fact, which
precedes the eventual classing of all the social elements in each great
race-synthesis, are mirrored in the hotch-potch genealogy of their
gods, in the legends of their fights, victories, and reconciliations.
Progress towards universal empires invariably means progress towards
universal deities; despotism, with its subjugation of the independent
nobility, always paves the way for some system or other of monotheism.)
The appearance of the Christian god, as the record god up to this time,
has for that very reason brought equally into the world the record
amount of guilt consciousness. Granted that we have gradually started
on the _reverse_ movement, there is no little probability in the
deduction, based on the continuous decay in the belief in the Christian
god, to the effect that there also already exists a considerable
decay in the human consciousness of owing (ought); in fact, we cannot
shut our eyes to the prospect of the complete and eventual triumph of
atheism freeing mankind from all this feeling of obligation to their
origin, their _causa prima_. Atheism and a kind of second innocence
complement and supplement each other.


21.

So much for my rough and preliminary sketch of the interrelation of
the ideas "ought" (owe) and "duty" with the postulates of religion. I
have intentionally shelved up to the present the actual moralisation
of these ideas (their being pushed back into the conscience, or more
precisely the interweaving of the _bad_ conscience with the idea of
God), and at the end of the last paragraph used language to the effect
that this moralisation did not exist, and that consequently these ideas
had necessarily come to an end, by reason of what had happened to their
hypothesis, the credence in our "creditor," in God. The actual facts
differ terribly from this theory. It is with the moralisation of the
ideas "ought" and "duty," and with their being pushed back into the
_bad_ conscience, that comes the first actual attempt to _reverse_ the
direction of the development we have just described, or at any rate
to arrest its evolution; it is just at this juncture that the very
hope of an eventual redemption _has to_ put itself once for all into
the prison of pessimism, it is at this juncture that the eye _has to_
recoil and rebound in despair from off an adamantine impossibility,
it is at this juncture that the ideas "guilt" and "duty" have to turn
backwards--turn backwards against _whom_? There is no doubt about
it; primarily against the "ower," in whom the bad conscience now
establishes itself, eats, extends, and grows like a polypus throughout
its length and breadth, all with such virulence, that at last, with
the impossibility of paying the debt, there becomes conceived the
idea of the impossibility of paying the penalty, the thought of its
inexpiability (the idea of "eternal punishment")--finally, too, it
turns against the "creditor," whether found in the _causa prima_ of
man, the origin of the human race, its sire, who henceforth becomes
burdened with a curse ("Adam," "original sin," "determination of the
will"), or in Nature from whose womb man springs, and on whom the
responsibility for the principle of evil is now cast ("Diabolisation of
Nature"), or in existence generally, on this logic an absolute _white
elephant_, with which mankind is landed (the Nihilistic flight from
life, the demand for Nothingness, or for the opposite of existence, for
some other existence, Buddhism and the like)--till suddenly we stand
before that paradoxical and awful expedient, through which a tortured
humanity has found a temporary alleviation, that stroke of genius
called Christianity:--God personally immolating himself for the debt of
man, God paying himself personally out of a pound of his own flesh, God
as the one being who can deliver man from what man had become unable to
deliver himself--the creditor playing scapegoat for his debtor, from
_love_ (can you believe it?), from love of his debtor!...

The reader will already have conjectured what took place on the stage
and behind the scenes of this drama. That will for self-torture, that
inverted cruelty of the animal man, who, turned subjective and scared
into introspection (encaged as he was in "the State," as part of his
taming process), invented the bad conscience so as to hurt himself,
after the _natural_ outlet for this will to hurt, became blocked--in
other words, this man of the bad conscience exploited the religious
hypothesis so as to carry his martyrdom to the ghastliest pitch of
agonised intensity. Owing something to _God_: this thought becomes his
instrument of torture. He apprehends in God the most extreme antitheses
that he can find to his own characteristic and ineradicable animal
instincts, he himself gives a new interpretation to these animal
instincts as being against what he "owes" to God (as enmity, rebellion,
and revolt against the "Lord," the "Father," the "Sire," the "Beginning
of the world"), he places himself between the horns of the dilemma,
"God" and "Devil." Every negation which he is inclined to utter to
himself, to the nature, naturalness, and reality of his being, he
whips into an ejaculation of "yes," uttering it as something existing,
living, efficient, as being God, as the holiness of God, the judgment
of God, as the hangmanship of God, as transcendence, as eternity, as
unending torment, as hell, as infinity of punishment and guilt. This is
a kind of madness of the will in the sphere of psychological cruelty
which is absolutely unparalleled:--man's _will_ to find himself guilty
and blameworthy to the point of inexpiability, his _will_ to think of
himself as punished, without the punishment ever being able to balance
the guilt, his _will_ to infect and to poison the fundamental basis
of the universe with the problem of punishment and guilt, in order to
cut off once and for all any escape out of this labyrinth of "fixed
ideas," his will for rearing an ideal--that of the "holy God"--face to
face with which he can have tangible proof of his own un-worthiness.
Alas for this mad melancholy beast man! What phantasies invade it,
what paroxysms of perversity, hysterical senselessness, and _mental
bestiality_ break out immediately, at the very slightest check on its
being the beast of action. All this is excessively interesting, but
at the same time tainted with a black, gloomy, enervating melancholy,
so that a forcible veto must be invoked against looking too long into
these abysses. Here is _disease_, undubitably, the most ghastly disease
that has as yet played havoc among men: and he who can still hear (but
man turns now deaf ears to such sounds), how in this night of torment
and nonsense there has rung out the cry of _love_, the cry of the most
passionate ecstasy, of redemption in _love_, he turns away gripped by
an invincible horror--in man there is so much that is ghastly--too long
has the world been a mad-house.


23.

Let this suffice once for all concerning the origin of the "holy God."
The fact that _in itself_ the conception of gods is not bound to
lead necessarily to this degradation of the imagination (a temporary
representation of whose vagaries we felt bound give), the fact that
there exist nobler methods of utilising the invention of gods than in
this self-crucifixion and self-degradation of man, in which the last
two thousand years of Europe have been past masters--these facts can
fortunately be still perceived from every glance that we cast at the
Grecian gods, these mirrors of noble and grandiose men, in which the
_animal_ in man felt itself deified, and did _not_ devour itself in
subjective frenzy. These Greeks long utilised their gods as simple
buffers against the "bad conscience"--so that they could continue
to enjoy their freedom of soul: this, of course, is diametrically
opposed to Christianity's theory of its god. They went _very far_ on
this principle, did these splendid and lion-hearted children; and
there is no lesser authority than that of the Homeric Zeus for making
them realise occasionally that they are taking life too casually.
"Wonderful," says he on one occasion--it has to do with the case of
Ægistheus, a _very_ bad case indeed--

    "Wonderful how they grumble, the mortals against the immortals,
    _Only from us_, they presume, _comes evil_, but in their folly,
    Fashion they, spite of fate, the doom of their own disaster."

Yet the reader will note and observe that this Olympian spectator and
judge is far from being angry with them and thinking evil of them on
this score. "How _foolish_ they are," so thinks he of the misdeeds
of mortals--and "folly," "imprudence," "a little brain disturbance,"
and nothing more, are what the Greeks, even of the strongest, bravest
period, have admitted to be the ground of much that is evil and
fatal.--Folly, _not_ sin, do you understand?... But even this brain
disturbance was a problem--"Come, how is it even possible? How could it
have really got in brains like ours, the brains of men of aristocratic
ancestry, of men of fortune, of men of good natural endowments, of
men of the best society, of men of nobility and virtue?" This was the
question that for century on century the aristocratic Greek put to
himself when confronted with every (to him incomprehensible) outrage
and sacrilege with which one of his peers had polluted himself. "It
must be that a god had infatuated him," he would say at last, nodding
his head.--This solution is _typical_ of the Greeks, ... accordingly
the gods in those times subserved the functions of justifying man to a
certain extent even in evil--in those days they took upon themselves
not the punishment, but, what is more noble, the guilt.


24.

I conclude with three queries, as you will see. "Is an ideal actually
set up here, or is one pulled down?" I am perhaps asked.... But have
ye sufficiently asked yourselves how dear a payment has the setting up
of every ideal in the world exacted? To achieve that consummation how
much truth must always be traduced and misunderstood, how many lies
must be sanctified, how much conscience has got to be disturbed, how
many pounds of "God" have got to be sacrificed every time? To enable
a sanctuary to be set up _a sanctuary has got to be destroyed_: that
is a law--show me an instance where it has not been fulfilled!...
We modern men, we inherit the immemorial tradition of vivisecting
the conscience, and practising cruelty to our animal selves. That is
the sphere of our most protracted training, perhaps of our artistic
prowess, at any rate of our dilettantism and our perverted taste. Man
has for too long regarded his natural proclivities with an "evil eye,"
so that eventually they have become in his system affiliated to a
bad conscience. A converse endeavour would be intrinsically feasible
--but who is strong enough to attempt it?--namely, to affiliate to
the "bad conscience" all those _unnatural_ proclivities, all those
transcendental aspirations, contrary to sense, instinct, nature, and
animalism--in short, all past and present ideals, which are all ideals
opposed to life, and traducing the world. To whom is one to turn
nowadays with _such_ hopes and pretensions?--It is just the _good_
men that we should thus bring about our ears; and in addition, as
stands to reason, the indolent, the hedgers, the vain, the hysterical,
the tired.... What is more offensive or more thoroughly calculated
to alienate, than giving any hint of the exalted severity with which
we treat ourselves? And again how conciliatory, how full of love
does all the world show itself towards us so soon as we do as all
the world docs, and "let ourselves go" like all the world. For such
a consummation we need spirits of _different_ calibre than seems
really feasible in this age; spirits rendered potent through wars and
victories, to whom conquest, adventure, danger, even pain, have become
a need; for such a consummation we need habituation to sharp, rare air,
to winter wanderings, to literal and metaphorical ice and mountains; we
even need a kind of sublime malice, a supreme and most self-conscious
insolence of knowledge, which is the appanage of great health; we need
(to summarise the awful truth) just this _great health_!

Is this even feasible to-day?... But some day, in a stronger age
than this rotting and introspective present, must he in sooth come
to us, even the _redeemer_ of great love and scorn, the creative
spirit, rebounding by the impetus of his own force back again away
from every transcendental plane and dimension, he whose solitude
is misunderstanded (sic) of the people, as though it were a flight
_from_ reality;--while actually it is only his diving, burrowing, and
penetrating _into_ reality, so that when he comes again to the light
he can at once bring about by these means the _redemption_ of this
reality; its redemption from the curse which the old ideal has laid
upon it. This man of the future, who in this wise will redeem us from
the old ideal, as he will from that ideal's necessary corollary of
great nausea, will to nothingness, and Nihilism; this tocsin of noon
and of the great verdict, which renders the will again free, who gives
back to the world its goal and to man his hope, this Antichrist and
Antinihilist, this conqueror of God and of Nothingness--_he must one
day come_.

But what am I talking of? Enough! Enough? At this juncture I have
only one proper course, silence: otherwise tresspass on a domain open
alone to one who is younger than I, one stronger, more "_future_" than
I--open alone to _Zarathustra, Zarathustra the godless._

THIRD ESSAY.


WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ASCETIC IDEALS?


"Careless, mocking, forceful--so does wisdom wish us: she is a woman,
and never loves any one but a warrior." Thus Spake Zarathustra.


1.

What is the meaning of ascetic ideals? In artists, nothing, or too
much; in philosophers and scholars, a kind of "flair" and instinct for
the conditions most favourable to advanced intellectualism; in women,
at best an _additional_ seductive fascination, a little _morbidezza_
on a fine piece of flesh, the angelhood of a fat, pretty animal; in
physiological failures and whiners (in the _majority_ of mortals),
an attempt to pose as "too good" for this world, a holy form of
debauchery, their chief weapon in the battle with lingering pain and
ennui; in priests, the actual priestly faith, their best engine of
power, and also the supreme authority for power; in saints, finally
a pretext for hibernation, their _novissima gloriæ cupido_, their
peace in nothingness ("God"), their form of madness.

But in the very fact that the ascetic ideal has meant so much to
man, lies expressed the fundamental feature of man's will, his
_horror vacui: he needs a goal_--and he will sooner will nothingness
than not will at all.--Am I not understood?--Have I not been
understood?--"Certainly not, sir?"--Well, let us begin at the beginning.


2.

What is the meaning of ascetic ideals? Or, to take an individual
case in regard to which I have often been consulted, what is the
meaning, for example, of an artist like Richard Wagner paying homage
to chastity in his old age? He had always done so, of course, in a
certain sense, but it was not till quite the end, that he did so in
an ascetic sense. What is the meaning of this "change of attitude,"
this radical revolution in his attitude--for that was what it was?
Wagner veered thereby straight round into his own opposite. What is
the meaning of an artist veering round into his own opposite? At
this point (granted that we do not mind stopping a little over this
question), we immediately call to mind the best, strongest, gayest,
and boldest period, that there perhaps ever was in Wagner's life: that
was the period, when he was genuinely and deeply occupied with the
idea of "Luther's Wedding." Who knows what chance is responsible for
our now having the _Meistersingers_ instead of this wedding music?
And how much in the latter is perhaps just an echo of the former? But
there is no doubt but that the theme would have dealt with the praise
of chastity. And certainly it would also have dealt with the praise
of sensuality, and even so, it would seem quite in order, and even
so, it would have been equally Wagnerian. For there is no necessary
antithesis between chastity and sensuality: every good marriage, every
authentic heart-felt love transcends this antithesis. Wagner would, it
seems to me, have done well to have brought this _pleasing_ reality
home once again to his Germans, by means of a bold and graceful "Luther
Comedy," for there were and are among the Germans many revilers of
sensuality; and perhaps Luther's greatest merit lies just in the fact
of his having had the courage of his _sensuality_ (it used to be
called, prettily enough, "evangelistic freedom "). But even in those
cases where that antithesis between chastity and sensuality does exist,
there has fortunately been for some time no necessity for it to be in
any way a tragic antithesis. This should, at any rate, be the case with
all beings who are sound in mind and body, who are far from reckoning
their delicate balance between "animal" and "angel," as being on the
face of it one of the principles opposed to existence--the most subtle
and brilliant spirits, such as Goethe, such as Hafiz,> have even seen
in this a _further_ charm of life. Such "conflicts" actually allure
one to life. On the other hand, it is only too clear that when once
these ruined swine are reduced to worshipping chastity--and there
are such swine--they only see and worship in it the antithesis to
themselves, the antithesis to ruined swine. Oh what a tragic grunting
and eagerness! You can just think of it--they worship that painful
and superfluous contrast, which Richard Wagner in his latter days
undoubtedly wished to set to music, and to place on the stage! "_For
what purpose, forsooth?_" as we may reasonably ask. What did the swine
matter to him; what do they matter to us?


3.

At this point it is impossible to beg the further question of what he
really had to do with that manly (ah, so unmanly) country bumpkin,
that poor devil and natural, Parsifal, whom he eventually made a
Catholic by such fraudulent devices. What? Was this Parsifal really
meant _seriously_? One might be tempted to suppose the contrary, even
to wish it--that the Wagnerian Parsifal was meant joyously, like a
concluding play of a trilogy or satyric drama, in which Wagner the
tragedian wished to take farewell of us, of himself, above all of
tragedy, and to do so in a manner that should be quite fitting and
worthy, that is, with an excess of the most extreme and flippant parody
of the tragic itself, of the ghastly earthly seriousness and earthly
woe of old--a parody of that _most crude phase_ in the unnaturalness
of the ascetic ideal, that had at length been overcome. That, as I
have said, would have been quite worthy of a great tragedian; who like
every artist first attains the supreme pinnacle of his greatness when
he can look _down_ into himself and his art, when he can _laugh_ at
himself. Is Wagner's Parsifal his secret laugh of superiority over
himself, the triumph of that supreme artistic freedom and artistic
transcendency which he has at length attained. We might, I repeat,
wish it were so, for what can Parsifal, _taken seriously_, amount to?
Is it really necessary to see in it (according to an expression once
used against me) the product of an insane hate of knowledge, mind,
and flesh? A curse on flesh and spirit in one breath of hate? An
apostasy and reversion to the morbid Christian and obscurantist ideals?
And finally a self-negation and self-elimination on the part of an
artist, who till then had devoted all the strength of his will to the
contrary, namely, the _highest_ artistic expression of soul and body.
And not only of his art; of his life as well. Just remember with what
enthusiasm Wagner followed in the footsteps of Feuerbach. Feuerbach's
motto of "healthy sensuality" rang in the ears of Wagner during the
thirties and forties of the century, as it did in the ears of many
Germans (they dubbed themselves "_Young_ Germans"), like the word of
redemption. Did he eventually _change his mind_ on the subject? For it
seems at any rate that he eventually wished to _change his teaching_
on that subject ... and not only is that the case with the Parsifal
trumpets on the stage: in the melancholy, cramped, and embarrassed
lucubrations of his later years, there are a hundred places in which
there are manifestations of a secret wish and will, a despondent,
uncertain, unavowed will to preach actual retrogression, conversion,
Christianity, mediævalism, and to say to his disciples, "All is vanity!
Seek salvation elsewhere!" Even the "blood of the Redeemer" is once
invoked.


4.

Let me speak out my mind in a case like this, which has many painful
elements--and it is a typical case: it is certainly best to separate
an artist from his work so completely that he cannot be taken as
seriously as his work. He is after all merely the presupposition of
his work, the womb, the soil, in certain cases the dung and manure,
on which and out of which it grows--and consequently, in most cases,
something that must be forgotten if the work itself is to be enjoyed.
The insight into the _origin_ of a work is a matter for psychologists
and vivisectors, but never either in the present or the future for the
æsthetes, the artists. The author and creator of Parsifal was as little
spared the necessity of sinking and living himself into the terrible
depths and foundations of mediæval soul-contrasts, the necessity of a
malignant abstraction from all intellectual elevation, severity, and
discipline, the necessity of a kind of mental perversity (if the reader
will pardon me such a word), as little as a pregnant woman is spared
the horrors and marvels of pregnancy, which, as I have said, must
be forgotten if the child is to be enjoyed. We must guard ourselves
against the confusion, into which an artist himself would fall only
too easily (to employ the English terminology) out of psychological
"contiguity"; as though the artist himself actually were the object
which he is able to represent, imagine, and express. In point of fact,
the position is that even if he conceived he were such an object, he
would certainly not represent, conceive, express it. Homer would not
have created an Achilles, nor Goethe a Faust, if Homer had been an
Achilles or if Goethe had been a Faust. A complete and perfect artist
is to all eternity separated from the "real," from the actual; on the
other hand, it will be appreciated that he can at times get tired to
the point of despair of this eternal "unreality" and falseness of his
innermost being--and that he then sometimes attempts to trespass on
to the most forbidden ground, on reality, and attempts to have real
_existence_. With what success? The success will be guessed--it is the
_typical velleity_ of the artist; the same velleity to which Wagner
fell a victim in his old age, and for which he had to pay so dearly and
so fatally (he lost thereby his most valuable friends). But after all,
quite apart from this velleity, who would not wish emphatically for
Wagner's own sake that he had taken farewell of us and of his art in a
_different_ manner, not with a _Parsifal_, but in more victorious, more
self-confident, more Wagnerian style--a style less misleading, a style
less ambiguous with regard to his whole meaning, less Schopenhauerian,
less Nihilistic?...


5.

What, then, is the meaning of ascetic ideals? In the case of an artist
we are getting to understand their meaning: _Nothing at all_ ... or so
much that it is as good as nothing at all. Indeed, what is the use of
them? Our artists have for a long time past not taken up a sufficiently
independent attitude, either in the world or against it, to warrant
their valuations and the changes in these valuations exciting interest.
At all times they have played the valet of some morality, philosophy,
or religion, quite apart from the fact that unfortunately they
have often enough been the inordinately supple courtiers of their
clients and patrons, and the inquisitive toadies of the powers that
are existing, or even of the new powers to come. To put it at the
lowest, they always need a rampart, a support, an already constituted
authority: artists never stand by themselves, standing alone is opposed
to their deepest instincts. So, for example, did _Richard Wagner_
take, "when the time had come," the philosopher Schopenhauer for his
covering man in front, for his rampart. Who would consider it even
thinkable, that he would have had the _courage_ for an ascetic ideal,
without the support afforded him by the philosophy of Schopenhauer,
without the authority of Schopenhauer, which _dominated_ Europe in the
seventies? (This is without consideration of the question whether an
artist without the milk[1] of an orthodoxy would have been possible at
all.) This brings us to the more serious question: What is the meaning
of a real _philosopher_ paying homage to the ascetic ideal, a really
self-dependent intellect like Schopenhauer, a man and knight with a
glance of bronze, who has the courage to be himself, who knows how to
stand alone without first waiting for men who cover him in front, and
the nods of his superiors? Let us now consider at once the remarkable
attitude of Schopenhauer towards _art_, an attitude which has even a
fascination for certain types. For that is obviously the reason why
Richard Wagner _all at once_ went over to Schopenhauer (persuaded
thereto, as one knows, by a poet, Herwegh), went over so completely
that there ensued the cleavage of a complete theoretic contradiction
between his earlier and his later æsthetic faiths--the earlier, for
example, being expressed in _Opera and Drama_, the later in the
writings which he published from 1870 onwards. In particular, Wagner
from that time onwards (and this is the volte-face which alienates us
the most) had no scruples about changing his judgment concerning the
value and position of music itself. What did he care if up to that time
he had made of music a means, a medium, a "woman," that in order to
thrive needed an end, a man--that is, the drama? He suddenly realised
that _more_ could be effected by the novelty of the Schopenhauerian
theory in _majorem musicæ gloriam_--that is to say, by means of the
_sovereignty_ of music, as Schopenhauer understood it; music abstracted
from and opposed to all the other arts, music as the independent
art-in-itself, _not_ like the other arts, affording reflections of the
phenomenal world, but rather the language of the will itself, speaking
straight out of the "abyss" as its most personal, original, and direct
manifestation. This extraordinary rise in the value of music (a rise
which seemed to grow out of the Schopenhauerian philosophy) was at
once accompanied by an unprecedented rise in the estimation in which
the musician himself was held: he became now an oracle, a priest, nay,
more than a priest, a kind of mouthpiece for the "intrinsic essence
of things," a telephone from the other world--from henceforward
he talked not only music, did this ventriloquist of God, he talked
metaphysic; what wonder that one day he eventually talked _ascetic
ideals_.


6.

Schopenhauer has made use of the Kantian treatment of the æsthetic
problem--though he certainly did not regard it with the Kantian eyes.
Kant thought that he showed honour to art when he favoured and placed
in the foreground those of the predicates of the beautiful, which
constitute the honour of knowledge: impersonality and universality.
This is not the place to discuss whether this was not a complete
mistake; all that I wish to emphasise is that Kant, just like other
philosophers, instead of envisaging the æsthetic problem from the
standpoint of the experiences of the artist (the creator), has only
considered art and beauty from the standpoint of the spectator, and
has thereby imperceptibly imported the spectator himself into the idea
of the "beautiful"! But if only the philosophers of the beautiful had
sufficient knowledge of this "spectator"!--Knowledge of him as a great
fact of personality, as a great experience, as a wealth of strong and
most individual events, desires, surprises, and raptures in the sphere
of beauty! But, as I feared, the contrary was always the case. And so
we get from our philosophers, from the very beginning, definitions
on which the lack of a subtler personal experience squats like a fat
worm of crass error, as it does on Kant's famous definition of the
beautiful. "That is beautiful," says Kant, "which pleases without
interesting." Without interesting! Compare this definition with this
other one, made by a real "spectator" and "artist"--by Stendhal, who
once called the beautiful _une promesse de bonheur_. Here, at any rate,
the one point which Kant makes prominent in the æsthetic position is
repudiated and eliminated--_le désintéressement_. Who is right, Kant
or Stendhal? When, forsooth, our æsthetes never get tired of throwing
into the scales in Kant's favour the fact that under the magic of
beauty men can look at even naked female statues "without interest,"
we can certainly laugh a little at their expense:--in regard to this
ticklish point the experiences of _artists_ are more "interesting,"
and at any rate Pygmalion was not necessarily an "unæsthetic man." Let
us think all the better of the innocence of our æsthetes, reflected
as it is in such arguments; let us, for instance, count to Kant's
honour the country-parson naïveté of his doctrine concerning the
peculiar character of the sense of touch! And here we come back to
Schopenhauer, who stood in much closer neighbourhood to the arts
than did Kant, and yet never escaped outside the pale of the Kantian
definition; how was that? The circumstance is marvellous enough: he
interprets the expression, "without interest," in the most personal
fashion, out of an experience which must in his case have been part and
parcel of his regular routine. On few subjects does Schopenhauer speak
with such certainty as on the working of æsthetic contemplation: he
says of it that it simply counteracts sexual interest, like lupulin
and camphor; he never gets tired of glorifying this escape from
the "Life-will" as the great advantage and utility of the æsthetic
state. In fact, one is tempted to ask if his fundamental conception
of Will and Idea, the thought that there can only exist freedom from
the "will" by means of "idea," did not originate in a generalisation
from this sexual experience. (In all questions concerning the
Schopenhauerian philosophy, one should, by the bye, never lose sight of
the consideration that it is the conception of a youth of twenty-six,
so that it participates not only in what is peculiar to Schopenhauer's
life, but in what is peculiar to that special period of his life.)
Let us listen, for instance, to one of the most expressive among the
countless passages which he has written in honour of the æsthetic
state (_World as Will and Idea_, i. 231); let us listen to the tone,
the suffering, the happiness, the gratitude, with which such words
are uttered: "This is the painless state which Epicurus praised as
the highest good and as the state of the gods; we are during that
moment freed from the vile pressure of the will, we celebrate the
Sabbath of the will's hard labour, the wheel of Ixion stands still."
What vehemence of language! What images of anguish and protracted
revulsion! How almost pathological is that temporal antithesis between
"that moment" and everything else, the "wheel of Ixion," "the hard
labour of the will," "the vile pressure of the will." But granted
that Schopenhauer was a hundred times right for himself personally,
how does that help our insight into the nature of the beautiful?
Schopenhauer has described one effect of the beautiful,--the calming
of the will,--but is this effect really normal? As has been mentioned,
Stendhal, an equally sensual but more happily constituted nature than
Schopenhauer, gives prominence to another effect of the "beautiful."
"The beautiful promises happiness." To him it is just the excitement
of the "will"(the "interest") by the beauty that seems the essential
fact. And does not Schopenhauer ultimately lay himself open to the
objection, that he is quite wrong in regarding himself as a Kantian on
this point, that he has absolutely failed to understand in a Kantian
sense the Kantian definition of the beautiful--;that the beautiful
pleased him as well by means of an interest, by means, in fact, of the
strongest and most personal interest of all, that: of the victim of
torture who escapes from his torture?--And to come back again to our
first question, "What is the meaning of a philosopher paying homage to
ascetic ideals?" We get now, at any rate, a first hint; he wishes to
escape _from a torture_.

Let us beware of making dismal faces at the word "torture"--there is
certainly in this case enough to deduct, enough to discount--there is
even something to laugh at. For we must certainly not underestimate
the fact that Schopenhauer, who in practice treated sexuality as
a personal enemy (including its tool, woman, that "_instrumentum
diaboli_"), needed enemies to keep him in a good humour; that he loved
grim, bitter, blackish-green words; that he raged for the sake of
raging, out of passion; that he would have grown ill, would have become
a _pessimist_ (for he was not a pessimist, however much he wished to
be), without his enemies, without Hegel, woman, sensuality, and the
whole "will for existence" "keeping on." Without them Schopenhauer
would not have "kept on," that is a safe wager; he would have run away:
but his enemies held him fast, his enemies always enticed him back
again to existence, his wrath was just as theirs' was to the ancient
Cynics, his balm, his recreation, his recompense, his _remedium_
against disgust, his _happiness_. So much with regard to what is most
personal in the case of Schopenhauer; on the other hand, there is
still much which is typical in him--and only now we come back to our
problem. It is an accepted and indisputable fact, so long as there
are philosophers in the world and wherever philosophers have existed
(from India to England, to take the opposite poles of philosophic
ability), that there exists a real irritation and rancour on the part
of philosophers towards sensuality. Schopenhauer is merely the most
eloquent, and if one has the ear for it, also the most fascinating
and enchanting outburst. There similarly exists a real philosophic
bias and affection for the whole ascetic ideal; there should be no
illusions on this score. Both these feelings, as has been said, belong
to the type; if a philosopher lacks both of them, then he is--you may
be certain of it--never anything but a "pseudo." What does this mean?
For this state of affairs must first be, interpreted: in itself it
stands there stupid, to all eternity, like any "Thing-in-itself." Every
animal, including la bête philosophe, strives instinctively after an
_optimum_ of favourable conditions, under which he can let his whole
strength have play, and achieves his maximum consciousness of power;
with equal instinctiveness, and with a fine perceptive flair which is
superior to any reason, every animal shudders mortally at every kind
of disturbance and hindrance which obstructs or could obstruct his way
to that optimum (it is not his way to happiness of which I am talking,
but his way to power, to action, the most powerful action, and in
point of fact in many cases his way to unhappiness). Similarly, the
philosopher shudders mortally at <b>marriage</b>, together with all
that could persuade him to it--marriage as a fatal hindrance on the
way to the _optimum_. Up to the present what great philosophers have
been married? Heracleitus, Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Kant,
Schopenhauer--they were not married, and, further, one cannot _imagine_
them as married. A married philosopher belongs to _comedy_, that is
my rule; as for that exception of a Socrates--the malicious Socrates
married himself, it seems, _ironice_, just to prove this _very_ rule.
Every philosopher would say, as Buddha said, when the birth of a son
was announced to him: "Râhoula has been born to me, a fetter has been
forged for me" (Râhoula means here "a little demon"); there must come
an hour of reflection to every "free spirit" (granted that he has had
previously an hour of thoughtlessness), just as one came once to the
same Buddha: "Narrowly cramped," he reflected, "is life in the house;
it is a place of uncleanness; freedom is found in leaving the house."
Because he thought like this, he left the house. So many bridges to
independence are shown in the ascetic idea], that the philosopher
cannot refrain from exultation and clapping of hands when he hears
the history of all those resolute ones, who on one day uttered a nay
to all servitude and went into some _desert_; even granting that they
were only strong asses, and the absolute opposite of strong minds.
What, then, does the ascetic ideal mean in a philosopher? This is my
answer--it will have been guessed long ago: when he sees this ideal
the philosopher smiles because he sees therein an _optimum_ of the
conditions of the highest and boldest intellectuality; he does not
thereby deny "existence," he rather affirms thereby _his_ existence
and _only_ his existence, and this perhaps to the point of not being
far off the blasphemous wish, _pereat mundus, fiat philosophia, fiat
philosophus, fiam!_


8.

These philosophers, you see, are by no means uncorrupted witnesses and
judges of the _value_ of the ascetic ideal. They think _of themselves_
--what is the "saint" to them? They think of that which to them
personally is most indispensable; of freedom from compulsion,
disturbance, noise: freedom from business, duties, cares; of clear
head; of the dance, spring, and flight of thoughts; of good air--rare,
clear, free, dry, as is the air on the heights, in which every animal
creature becomes more intellectual and gains wings; they think of
peace in every cellar; all the hounds neatly chained; no baying of
enmity and uncouth rancour; no remorse of wounded ambition; quiet
and submissive internal organs, busy as mills, but unnoticed; the
heart alien, transcendent, future, posthumous--to summarise, they
mean by the ascetic ideal the joyous asceticism of a deified and
newly fledged animal, sweeping over life rather than resting. We know
what are the three great catch-words of the ascetic ideal: poverty,
humility, chastity; and now just look closely at the life of all
the great fruitful inventive spirits--you will always find again
and again these three qualities up to a certain extent. _Not_ for a
minute, as is self-evident, as though, perchance, they were part of
their virtues--what has this type of man to do with virtues?--but as
the most essential and natural conditions of their _best_ existence,
their _finest_ fruitfulness. In this connection it is quite possible
that their predominant intellectualism had first to curb an unruly and
irritable pride, or an insolent sensualism, or that it had all its
work cut out to maintain its wish for the "desert" against perhaps
an inclination to luxury and dilettantism, or similarly against an
extravagant liberality of heart and hand. But their intellect did
effect all this, simply because it was the _dominant_ instinct, which
carried through its orders in the case of all the other instincts.
It effects it still; if it ceased to do so, it would simply not be
dominant. But there is not one iota of "virtue" in all this. Further,
the _desert_, of which I just spoke, in which the strong, independent,
and well-equipped spirits retreat into their hermitage--oh, how
different is it from the cultured classes' dream of a desert! In
certain cases, in fact, the cultured classes themselves are the desert.
And it is certain that all the actors of the intellect would not endure
this desert for a minute. It is nothing like romantic and Syrian enough
for them, nothing like enough of a stage desert! Here as well there
are plenty of asses, but at this point the resemblance ceases. But a
desert nowadays is something like this--perhaps a deliberate obscurity;
a getting-out-of the way of one's self; a fear of noise, admiration,
papers, influence; a little office, a daily task, something that hides
rather than brings to light; sometimes associating with harmless,
cheerful beasts and fowls, the sight of which refreshes; a mountain for
company, but not a dead one, one with _eyes_ (that is, with lakes);
in certain cases even a room in a crowded hotel where one can reckon
on not being recognised, and on being able to talk with impunity to
every one: here is the desert--oh, it is lonely enough, believe me!
I grant that when Heracleitus retreated to the courts and cloisters
of the colossal temple of Artemis, that "wilderness" was worthier;
why do we _lack_ such temples? (perchance we do not lack them: I just
think of my splendid study in the _Piazza di San Marco_, in spring, of
course, and in the morning, between ten and twelve). But that which
Heracleitus shunned is still just what we too avoid nowadays: the
noise and democratic babble of the Ephesians, their politics, their
news from the "empire" (I mean, of course, Persia), their market-trade
in "the things of to-day "--for there is one thing from which we
philosophers especially need a rest--from the things of "to-day." We
honour the silent, the cold, the noble, the far, the past, everything,
in fact, at the sight of which the soul is not bound to brace itself up
and defend itself--something with which one can speak without _speaking
aloud_. Just listen now to the tone a spirit has when it speaks; every
spirit has its own tone and loves its own tone. That thing yonder, for
instance, is bound to be an agitator, that is, a hollow head, a hollow
mug: whatever may go into him, everything comes back from him dull and
thick, heavy with the echo of the great void. That spirit yonder nearly
always speaks hoarse: has he, perchance, _thought_ himself hoarse?
It may be so--ask the physiologists--but he who thinks in _words_,
thinks as a speaker and not as a thinker (it shows that he does not
think of objects or think objectively, but only of his relations
with objects--that, in point of fact, he only thinks of himself and
his audience). This third one speaks aggressively, he comes too near
our body, his breath blows on us--we shut our mouth involuntarily,
although he speaks to us through a book: the tone of his style supplies
the reason--he has no time, he has small faith in himself, he finds
expression now or never. But a spirit who is sure of himself speaks
softly; he seeks secrecy, he lets himself be awaited, A philosopher
is recognised by the fact that he shuns three brilliant and noisy
things--fame, princes, and women: which is not to say that they do not
come to him. He shuns every glaring light: therefore he shuns his time
and its "daylight." Therein he is as a shadow; the deeper sinks the
sun, the greater grows the shadow. As for his humility, he endures, as
he endures darkness, a certain dependence and obscurity: further, he is
afraid of the shock of lightning, he shudders at the insecurity of a
tree which is too isolated and too exposed, on which every storm vents
its temper, every temper its storm. His "maternal" instinct, his secret
love for that which grows in him, guides him into states where he is
relieved from the necessity of taking care of _himself_, in the same
way in which the "_mother_" instinct in woman has thoroughly maintained
up to the present woman's dependent position. After all, they demand
little enough, do these philosophers, their favourite motto is, "He
who possesses is possessed." All this is _not_, as I must say again
and again, to be attributed to a virtue, to a meritorious wish for
moderation and simplicity; but because their supreme lord so demands
of them, demands wisely and inexorably; their lord who is eager only
for one thing, for which alone he musters, and for which alone he
hoards everything--time, strength, love, interest. This kind of man
likes not to be disturbed by enmity, he likes not to be disturbed by
friendship, it is a type which forgets or despises easily. It strikes
him as bad form to play the martyr, "to _suffer_ for truth"--he leaves
all that to the ambitious and to the stage-heroes of the intellect,
and to all those, in fact, who have time enough for such luxuries
(they themselves, the philosophers, have something _to do_ for truth).
They make a sparing use of big words; they are said to be adverse to
the word "truth" itself: it has a "high falutin'" ring. Finally, as
far as the chastity of philosophers is concerned, the fruitfulness
of this type of mind is manifestly in another sphere than that of
children; perchance in some other sphere, too, they have the survival
of their name, their little immortality (philosophers in ancient
India would express themselves with still greater boldness: "Of what
use is posterity to him whose soul is the world?"). In this attitude
there is not a trace of chastity, by reason of any ascetic scruple or
hatred of the flesh, any more than it is chastity for an athlete or a
jockey to abstain from women; it is rather the will of the dominant
instinct, at any rate, during the period of their advanced philosophic
pregnancy. Every artist knows the harm done by sexual intercourse
on occasions of great mental strain and preparation; as far as the
strongest artists and those with the surest instincts are concerned,
this is not necessarily a case of experience--hard experience--but it
is simply their "maternal" instinct which, in order to benefit the
growing work, disposes recklessly (beyond all its normal stocks and
supplies) of the _vigour_ of its _animal_ life; the greater power then
_absorbs_ the lesser. Let us now apply this interpretation to gauge
correctly the case of Schopenhauer, which we have already mentioned: in
his case, the sight of the beautiful acted manifestly like a resolving
irritant on the chief power of his nature (the power of contemplation
and of intense penetration); so that this strength exploded and became
suddenly master of his consciousness. But this by no means excludes
the possibility of that particular sweetness and fulness, which is
peculiar to the æsthetic state, springing directly from the ingredient
of sensuality (just as that "idealism" which is peculiar to girls at
puberty originates in the same source)--it may be, consequently, that
sensuality is not removed by the approach of the æsthetic state, as
Schopenhauer believed, but merely becomes transfigured, and ceases to
enter into the consciousness as sexual excitement. (I shall return once
again to this point in connection with the more delicate problems of
the _physiology of the æsthetic_, a subject which up to the present has
been singularly untouched and unelucidated.)


9.

A certain asceticism, a grimly gay whole-hearted renunciation, is, as
we have seen, one of the most favourable conditions for the highest
intellectualism, and, consequently, for the most natural corollaries
of such intellectualism: we shall therefore be proof against any
surprise at the philosophers in particular always treating the ascetic
ideal with a certain amount of predilection. A serious historical
investigation shows the bond between the ascetic ideal and philosophy
to be still much tighter and still much stronger. It may be said that
it was only in the _leading strings_ of this ideal that philosophy
really learnt to make its first steps and baby paces--alas how
clumsily, alas how crossly, alas how ready to tumble down and lie on
its stomach was this shy little darling of a brat with its bandy legs!
The early history of philosophy is like that of all good things;--for a
long time they had not the courage to be themselves, they kept always
looking round to see if no one would come to their help; further, they
were afraid of all who looked at them. Just enumerate in order the
particular tendencies and virtues of the philosopher--his tendency to
doubt, his tendency to deny, his tendency to wait (to be "ephectic"),
his tendency to analyse, search, explore, dare, his tendency to compare
and to equalise, his will to be neutral and objective, his will for
everything which is "_sine ira et studio_":--has it yet been realised
that for quite a lengthy period these tendencies went counter to the
first claims of morality and conscience? (To say nothing at all of
_Reason_, which even Luther chose to call _Frau Klüglin_,[2] the sly
whore.) Has it been yet appreciated that a philosopher, in the event
of his _arriving_ at self-consciousness, must needs feel himself an
incarnate "nitimur in vetitum"--and consequently guard himself against
"his own sensations," against self-consciousness? It is, I repeat, just
the same with all good things, on which we now pride ourselves; even
judged by the standard of the ancient Greeks, our whole modern life,
in so far as it is not weakness, but power and the consciousness of
power, appears pure "Hybris" and godlessness: for the things which are
the very reverse of those which we honour to-day, have had for a long
time conscience on their side, and God as their guardian. "Hybris"
is our whole attitude to nature nowadays, our violation of nature
with the help of machinery, and all the unscrupulous ingenuity of our
scientists and engineers. "Hybris" is our attitude to God, that is, to
some alleged teleological and ethical spider behind the meshes of the
great trap of the causal web. Like Charles the Bold in his war with
Louis the Eleventh, we may say, "je combats l'universelle araignée";
"Hybris" is our attitude to ourselves--for we experiment with ourselves
in a way that we would not allow with any animal, and with pleasure
and curiosity open our soul in our living body: what matters now to
us the "salvation" of the soul? We heal ourselves afterwards: being
ill is instructive, we doubt it not, even more instructive than being
well--inoculators of disease seem to us to-day even more necessary
than any medicine-men and "saviours." There is no doubt we do violence
to ourselves nowadays, we crackers of the soul's kernel, we incarnate
riddles, who are ever asking riddles, as though life were naught else
than the cracking of a nut; and even thereby must we necessarily become
day by day more and more worthy to be asked questions and worthy to ask
them, even thereby do we perchance also become worthier to--live?

... All good things were once bad things; from every original sin has
grown an original virtue. Marriage, for example, seemed for a long time
a sin against the rights of the community; a man formerly paid a fine
for the insolence of claiming one woman to himself (to this phase
belongs, for instance, the _jus primæ noctis_, to-day still in Cambodia
the privilege of the priest, that guardian of the "good old customs").

The soft, benevolent, yielding, sympathetic feelings--eventually valued
so highly that they almost became "intrinsic values," were for a very
long time actually despised by their possessors: gentleness was then
a subject for shame, just as hardness is now (compare _Beyond Good
and Evil_, Aph. 260). The submission to law: oh, with what qualms of
conscience was it that the noble races throughout the world renounced
the _vendetta_ and gave the law power over themselves! Law was long a
_vetitum_, a blasphemy, an innovation; it was introduced with force,
like a force, to which men only submitted with a sense of personal
shame. Every tiny step forward in the world was formerly made at
the cost of mental and physical torture. Nowadays the whole of this
point of view--"that not only stepping forward, nay, stepping at all,
movement, change, all needed their countless martyrs," rings in our
ears quite strangely. I have put it forward in the _Dawn of Day_, Aph.
18. "Nothing is purchased more dearly," says the same book a little
later, "than the modicum of human reason and freedom which is now our
pride. But that pride is the reason why it is now almost impossible
for us to feel in sympathy with those immense periods of the 'Morality
of Custom,' which lie at the beginning of the 'world's history,'
constituting as they do the real decisive historical principle which
has fixed the character of humanity; those periods, I repeat, when
throughout the world suffering passed for virtue, cruelty for virtue,
deceit for virtue, revenge for virtue, repudiation of the reason for
virtue; and when, conversely, well-being passed current for danger, the
desire for knowledge for danger, pity for danger, peace for danger,
being pitied for shame, work for shame, madness for divinity, and
_change_ for immorality and incarnate corruption!"


10.

There is in the same book, Aph. 12, an explanation of the _burden_
of unpopularity under which the earliest race of contemplative men
had to live--despised almost as widely as they were first feared!
Contemplation first appeared on earth in a disguised shape, in an
ambiguous form, with an evil heart and often with an uneasy head:
there is no doubt about it. The inactive, brooding, unwarlike element
in the instincts of contemplative men long invested them with a cloud
of suspicion: the only way to combat this was to excite a definite
_fear_. And the old Brahmans, for example, knew to a nicety how to do
this! The oldest philosophers were well versed in giving to their very
existence and appearance, meaning, firmness, background, by reason
whereof men learnt to _fear_ them; considered more precisely, they
did this from an even more fundamental need, the need of inspiring
in themselves fear and self-reverence. For they found even in their
own souls all the valuations turned _against_ themselves; they had
to fight down every kind of suspicion and antagonism against "the
philosophic element in themselves." Being men of a terrible age,
they did this with terrible means: cruelty to themselves, ingenious
self-mortification--this was the chief method of these ambitious
hermits and intellectual revolutionaries, who were obliged to force
down the gods and the traditions of their own soul, so as to enable
themselves to _believe_ in their own revolution. I remember the famous
story of the King Vicvamitra, who, as the result of a thousand years
of self-martyrdom, reached such a consciousness of power and such a
confidence in himself that he undertook to build a _new heaven_: the
sinister symbol of the oldest and newest history of philosophy in the
whole world. Every one who has ever built anywhere a "_new heaven_"
first found the power thereto in his _own hell_.. .. Let us compress
the facts into a short formula. The philosophic spirit had, in order
to be _possible_ to any extent at all, to masquerade and disguise
itself as one of the _previously fixed_ types of the contemplative
man, to disguise itself as priest, wizard, soothsayer, as a religious
man generally: the _ascetic ideal_ has for a long time served the
philosopher as a superficial form, as a condition which enabled him
to exist. .. . To be able to be a philosopher he had to exemplify the
ideal; to exemplify it, he was bound to _believe_ in it. The peculiarly
etherealised abstraction of philosophers, with their negation of the
world, their enmity to life, their disbelief in the senses, which has
been maintained up to the most recent time, and has almost thereby come
to be accepted as the ideal _philosophic attitude_--this abstraction
is the result of those enforced conditions under which philosophy
came into existence, and continued to exist; inasmuch as for quite
a very long time philosophy would have been _absolutely impossible_
in the world without an ascetic cloak and dress, without an ascetic
self-misunderstanding. Expressed plainly and palpably, the _ascetic
priest_ has taken the repulsive and sinister form of the caterpillar,
beneath which and behind which alone philosophy could live and slink
about.. ..

Has all that really changed? Has that flamboyant and dangerous winged
creature, that "spirit" which that caterpillar concealed within itself,
has it, I say, thanks to a sunnier, warmer, lighter world, really
and finally flung off its hood and escaped into the light? Can we
to-day point to enough pride, enough daring, enough courage, enough
self-confidence, enough mental will, enough will for responsibility,
enough freedom of the will, to enable the philosopher to be now in the
world really--_possible_?


11.

And now, after we have caught sight of the _ascetic priest_, let us
tackle our problem. What is the meaning of the ascetic ideal? It now
first becomes serious--vitally serious. We are now confronted with the
_real representatives of the serious_. "What is the meaning of all
seriousness?" This even more radical question is perchance already
on the tip of our tongue: a question, fairly, for physiologists, but
which we for the time being skip. In that ideal the ascetic priest
finds not only his faith, but also his will, his power, his interest.
His _right_ to existence stands and falls with that ideal. What wonder
that we here run up against a terrible opponent (on the supposition,
of course, that we are the opponents of that ideal), an opponent
fighting for his life against those who repudiate that ideal!. .. On
the other hand, it is from the outset improbable that such a biased
attitude towards our problem will do him any particular good; the
ascetic priest himself will scarcely prove the happiest champion of
his own ideal (on the same principle on which a woman usually fails
when she wishes to champion "woman")--let alone proving the most
objective critic and judge of the controversy now raised. We shall
therefore--so much is already obvious--rather have actually to help
him to defend himself properly against ourselves, than we shall have
to fear being too well beaten by him. The idea, which is the subject
of this dispute, is the value of our life from the standpoint of the
ascetic priests: this life, then (together with the whole of which it
is a part, "Nature," "the world," the whole sphere of becoming and
passing away), is placed by them in relation to an existence of quite
another character, which it excludes and to which it is opposed, unless
it _deny_ its own self: in this case, the case of an ascetic life,
life is taken as a bridge to another existence. The ascetic treats
life as a maze, in which one must walk backwards till one comes to the
place where it starts; or he treats it as an error which one may, nay
_must_, refute by action: for he demands that he should be followed;
he enforces, where he can, his valuation of existence. What does this
mean? Such a monstrous valuation is not an exceptional case, or a
curiosity recorded in human history: it is one of the most general
and persistent facts that there are. The reading from the vantage
of a distant star of the capital letters of our earthly life, would
perchance lead to the conclusion that the earth was the especially
_ascetic planet_, a den of discontented, arrogant, and repulsive
creatures, who never got rid of a deep disgust of themselves, of the
world, of all life, and did themselves as much hurt as possible out
of pleasure in hurting--presumably their one and only pleasure. Let
us consider how regularly, how universally, how practically at every
single period the ascetic priest puts in his appearance: he belongs to
no particular race; he thrives everywhere; he grows out of all classes.
Not that he perhaps bred this valuation by heredity and propagated
it--the contrary is the case. It must be a necessity of the first order
which makes this species, hostile, as it is, to _life_, always grow
again and always thrive again.--_Life_ itself must certainly _have an
interest_ in the continuance of such a type of self-contradiction. For
an ascetic life is a self-contradiction: here rules resentment without
parallel, the resentment of an insatiate instinct and ambition, that
would be master, not over some element in life, but over life itself,
over life's deepest, strongest, innermost conditions; here is an
attempt made to utilise power to dam the sources of power; here does
the green eye of jealousy turn even against physiological well-being,
especially against the expression of such well-being, beauty, joy;
while a sense of pleasure is experienced and _sought_ in abortion, in
decay, in pain, in misfortune, in ugliness, in voluntary punishment,
in the exercising, flagellation, and sacrifice of the self. All this
is in the highest degree paradoxical: we are here confronted with a
rift that _wills_ itself to be a rift, which _enjoys_ itself in this
very _suffering_, and even becomes more and more certain of itself,
more and more triumphant, in proportion as its own presupposition,
physiological vitality, _decreases_. "The triumph just in the supreme
agony ": under this extravagant emblem did the ascetic ideal fight from
of old; in this mystery of seduction, in this picture of rapture and
torture, it recognised its brightest light, its salvation, its final
victory. _Crux, nux, lux_--it has all these three in one.


12.

Granted that such an incarnate will for contradiction and unnaturalness
is induced to _philosophise_; on what will it vent its pet caprice?
On that which has been felt with the greatest certainty to be true,
to be real; it will look for _error_ in those very places where the
life instinct fixes truth with the greatest positiveness. It will, for
instance, after the example of the ascetics of the Vedanta Philosophy,
reduce matter to an illusion, and similarly treat pain, multiplicity,
the whole logical contrast of "_Subject_" and "_Object_"--errors,
nothing but errors! To renounce the belief in one's own ego, to
deny to one's self one's own "reality"--what a triumph! and here
already we have a much higher kind of triumph, which is not merely
a triumph over the senses, over the palpable, but an infliction of
violence and cruelty on _reason_; and this ecstasy culminates in the
ascetic self-contempt, the ascetic scorn of one's own reason making
this decree: _there is_ a domain of truth and of life, but reason is
specially _excluded_ therefrom.. .. By the bye, even in the Kantian
idea of "the intellegible character of things" there remains a trace
of that schism, so dear to the heart of the ascetic, that schism
which likes to turn reason against reason; in fact, "intelligible
character" means in Kant a kind of quality in things of which the
intellect comprehends this much, that for it, the intellect, it is
_absolutely incomprehensible_. After all, let us, in our character
of knowers, not be ungrateful towards such determined reversals of
the ordinary perspectives and values, with which the mind had for
too long raged against itself with an apparently futile sacrilege!
In the same way the very seeing of another vista, the very _wishing_
to see another vista, is no little training and preparation of the
intellect for its eternal "_Objectivity_"--objectivity being understood
not as "contemplation without interest" (for that is inconceivable
and non-sensical), but as the ability to have the pros and cons _in
one's power_ and to switch them on and off, so as to get to know how
to utilise, for the advancement of knowledge, the _difference_ in
the perspective and in the emotional interpretations. But let us,
forsooth, my philosophic colleagues, henceforward guard ourselves more
carefully against this mythology of dangerous ancient ideas, which has
set up a "pure, will-less, painless, timeless subject of knowledge";
let us guard ourselves from the tentacles of such contradictory ideas
as "pure reason," "absolute spirituality," "knowledge-in-itself":--in
these theories an eye that cannot be thought of is required to think,
an eye which ex hypothesi has no direction at all, an eye in which
the active and interpreting functions are cramped, are absent; those
functions, I say, by means of which "abstract" seeing first became
seeing something; in these theories consequently the absurd and the
non-sensical is always demanded of the eye. There is only a seeing
from a perspective, only a "knowing" from a perspective, and the more
emotions we express over a thing, the more eyes, different eyes, we
train on the same thing, the more complete will be our "idea" of that
thing, our "objectivity." But the elimination of the will altogether,
the switching off of the emotions all and sundry, granted that we could
do so, what! would not that be called intellectual castration?

But let us turn back. Such a self-contradiction, as apparently
manifests itself among the ascetics, "Life turned against Life,"
is--this much is absolutely obvious--from the physiological and not now
from the psychological standpoint, simply nonsense. It can only be an
apparent contradiction; it must be a kind of provisional expression, an
explanation, a formula, an adjustment, a psychological misunderstanding
of something, whose real nature could not be understood for a long
time, and whose _real essence_ could not be described; a mere word
jammed into an old _gap_ of human knowledge. To put briefly the
facts against its being real: _the ascetic ideal springs from the
prophylactic and self-preservative instincts which mark a decadent
life_, which seeks by every means in its power to maintain its position
and fight for its existence; it points to a partial physiological
depression and exhaustion, against which the most profound and intact
life-instincts fight ceaselessly with new weapons and discoveries. The
ascetic ideal is such a weapon: its position is consequently exactly
the reverse of that which the worshippers of the ideal imagine--life
struggles in it and through it with death and against death; the
ascetic ideal is a dodge for the _preservation_ of life. An important
fact is brought out in the extent to which, as history teaches, this
ideal could rule and exercise power over man, especially in all those
places where the civilisation and taming of man was completed: that
fact is, the diseased state of man up to the present, at any rate, of
the man who has been tamed, the physiological struggle of man with
death (more precisely, with the disgust with life, with exhaustion,
with the wish for the "end"). The ascetic priest is the incarnate wish
for an existence of another kind, an existence on another plane,--he
is, in fact, the highest point of this wish, its official ecstasy and
passion: but it is the very _power_ of this wish which is the fetter
that binds him here; it is just that which makes him into a tool that
must labour to create more favourable conditions for earthly existence,
for existence on the human plane--it is with this very power that he
keeps the whole herd of failures, distortions, abortions, unfortunates,
_sufferers from themselves_ of every kind, fast to existence, while
he as the herdsman goes instinctively on in front. You understand
me already: this ascetic priest, this apparent enemy of life, this
denier--he actually belongs to the really great _conservative_ and
_affirmative_ forces of life.... What does it come from, this diseased
state? For man is more diseased, more uncertain, more changeable,
more unstable than any other animal, there is no doubt of it--he is
the diseased animal: what does it spring from? Certainly he has also
dared, innovated, braved more, challenged fate more than all the other
animals put together; he, the great experimenter with himself, the
unsatisfied, the insatiate, who struggles for the supreme mastery with
beast, Nature, and gods, he, the as yet ever uncompelled, the ever
future, who finds no more any rest from his own aggressive strength,
goaded inexorably on by the spur of the future dug into the flesh of
the present:--how should not so brave and rich an animal also be the
most endangered, the animal with the longest and deepest sickness
among all sick animals?... Man is sick of it, oft enough there are
whole epidemics of this satiety (as about 1348, the time of the Dance
of Death): but even this very nausea, this tiredness, this disgust
with himself, all this is discharged from him with such force that
it is immediately made into a new fetter. His "nay," which he utters
to life, brings to light as though by magic an abundance of graceful
"yeas"; even when he _wounds_ himself, this master of destruction, of
self-destruction, it is subsequently the wound itself that forces him
to live.


14.

The more normal is this sickliness in man--and we cannot dispute
this normality--the higher honour should be paid to the rare cases
of psychical and physical powerfulness, the _windfalls_ of humanity,
and the more strictly should the sound be guarded from that worst of
air, the air of the sick-room. Is that done? The sick are the greatest
danger for the healthy; it is not from the strongest that harm comes to
the strong, but from the weakest. Is that known? Broadly considered,
it is not for a minute the fear of man, whose diminution should be
wished for; for this fear forces the strong to be strong, to be at
times terrible--it preserves in its integrity the sound type of man.
What is to be feared, what does work with a fatality found in no other
fate, is not the great fear of, but the great _nausea_ with, man; and
equally so the great pity for man. Supposing that both these things
were one day to espouse each other, then inevitably the maximum of
monstrousness would immediately come into the world--the "last will"
of man, his will for nothingness, Nihilism. And, in sooth, the way is
well paved thereto. He who not only has his nose to smell with, but
also has eyes and ears, he sniffs almost wherever he goes to-day an
air something like that of a mad-house, the air of a hospital--I am
speaking, as stands to reason, of the cultured areas of mankind, of
every kind of "Europe" that there is in fact in the world. The _sick_
are the great danger of man, _not_ the evil, _not_ the "beasts of
prey." They who are from the outset botched, oppressed, broken, those
are they, the weakest are they, who most undermine the life beneath the
feet of man, who instil the most dangerous venom and scepticism into
our trust in life, in man, in ourselves. Where shall we escape from
it, from that covert look (from which we carry away a deep sadness),
from that averted look of him who is misborn from the beginning, that
look which betrays what such a man says to himself--that look which is
a groan?" Would that I were something else," so groans this look, "but
there is no hope. I am what I am: how could I get away from myself?
And, verily--_I am sick of myself!_" On such a soil of self-contempt,
a veritable swamp soil, grows that weed, that poisonous growth, and
all so tiny, so hidden, so ignoble, so sugary. Here teem the worms
of revenge and vindictiveness; here the air reeks of things secret
and unmentionable; here is ever spun the net of the most malignant
conspiracy--the conspiracy of the sufferers against the sound and the
victorious; here is the sight of the victorious _hated_. And what
lying so as not to acknowledge this hate as hate! What a show of big
words and attitudes, what an art of "righteous" calumniation! These
abortions! what a noble eloquence gushes from their lips! What an
amount of sugary, slimy, humble submission oozes in their eyes! What do
they really want? At any rate to _represent_ righteousness ness, love,
wisdom, superiority, that is the ambition of these "lowest ones," these
sick ones! And how clever does such an ambition make them! You cannot,
in fact, but admire the counterfeiter dexterity with which the stamp
of virtue, even the ring, the golden ring of virtue, is here imitated.
They have taken a lease of virtue absolutely for themselves, have these
weaklings and wretched invalids, there is no doubt of it; "We alone are
the good, the righteous," so do they speak, "we alone are the _homines
bonæ voluntatis_." They stalk about in our midst as living reproaches,
as warnings to us--as though health, fitness, strength, pride, the
sensation of power, were really vicious things in themselves, for
which one would have some day to do penance, bitter penance. Oh, how
they themselves are ready in their hearts to exact penance, how they
thirst after being _hangmen_!

Among them is an abundance of revengeful ones disguised as judges,
who ever mouth the word righteousness like a venomous spittle--with
mouth, I say, always pursed, always ready to spit at everything,
which does not wear a discontented look, but is of good cheer as it
goes on its way. Among them, again, is that most loathsome species
of the vain, the lying abortions, who make a point of representing
"beautiful souls," and perchance of bringing to the market as "purity
of heart" their distorted sensualism swathed in verses and other
bandages; the species of "self-comforters" and masturbators of their
own souls. The sick man's will to represent _some_ form or other of
superiority, his instinct for crooked paths, which lead to a tyranny
over the healthy--where can it not be found, this will to power of
the very weakest? The sick woman especially: no one surpasses her
in refinements for ruling, oppressing, tyrannising. The sick woman,
moreover, spares nothing living, nothing dead; she grubs up again the
most buried things (the Bogos say, "Woman is a hyena"). Look into
the background of every family, of every body, of every community:
everywhere the fight of the sick against the healthy--a silent fight
for the most part with minute poisoned powders, with pin-pricks, with
spiteful grimaces of patience, but also at times with that diseased
pharisaism of _pure_ pantomime, which plays for choice the rôle of
"righteous indignation." Right into the hallowed chambers of knowledge
can it make itself heard, can this hoarse yelping of sick hounds, this
rabid lying and frenzy of such "noble" Pharisees (I remind readers, who
have ears, once more of that Berlin apostle of revenge, Eugen Dühring,
who makes the most disreputable and revolting use in all present-day
Germany of moral refuse; Dühring, the paramount moral blusterer that
there is to-day, even among his own kidney, the Anti-Semites). They
are all men of resentment, are these physiological distortions and
worm-riddled objects, a whole quivering kingdom of burrowing revenge,
indefatigable and insatiable in its outbursts against the happy, and
equally so in disguises for revenge, in pretexts for revenge: when
will they really reach their final, fondest, most sublime triumph of
revenge? At that time, doubtless, when they succeed in pushing their
own misery, in fact, all misery, _into the consciousness_ of the happy;
so that the latter begin one day to be ashamed of their happiness,
and perchance say to themselves when they meet, "It is a shame to be
happy! _there is too much misery!_" ... But there could not possibly
be a greater and more fatal misunderstanding than that of the happy,
the fit, the strong in body and soul, beginning in this way to doubt
their right to happiness. Away with this "perverse world"! Away with
this shameful soddenness of sentiment! Preventing the sick making the
healthy sick--for that is what such a soddenness comes to--this ought
to be our supreme object in the world--but for this it is above all
essential that the healthy should remain _separated_ from the sick,
that they should even guard themselves from the look of the sick, that
they should not even associate with the sick. Or may it, perchance,
be their mission to be nurses or doctors? But they could not mistake
and disown their mission more grossly--the higher must not degrade
itself to be the tool of the lower, the pathos of distance must to all
eternity keep their missions also separate. The right of the happy to
existence, the right of bells with a full tone over the discordant
cracked bells, is verily a thousand times greater: they alone are the
_sureties_ of the future, they alone are _bound_ to man's future. What
they can, what they must do, that can the sick never do, should never
do! but if _they are to_ be enabled to do what _only_ they must do,
how can they possibly be free to play the doctor, the comforter, the
"Saviour" of the sick?... And therefore good air! good air! and away,
at any rate, from the neighbourhood of all the madhouses and hospitals
of civilisation! And therefore good company, _our own_ company, or
solitude, if it must be so! but away, at any rate, from the evil fumes
of internal corruption and the secret worm-eaten state of the sick!
that, forsooth, my friends, we may defend ourselves, at any rate for
still a time, against the two worst plagues that could have been
reserved for us--against the _great nausea with man_! against the_
great pity for man_!


15.

If you have understood in all their depths--and I demand that you
should _grasp them profoundly_ and understand them profoundly--the
reasons for the impossibility of its being the business of the healthy
to nurse the sick, to make the sick healthy, it follows that you have
grasped this further necessity--the necessity of doctors and nurses
_who themselves are sick_. And now we have and hold with both our hands
the essence of the ascetic priest. The ascetic priest must be accepted
by us as the predestined saviour, herdsman, and champion of the sick
herd: thereby do we first understand his awful historic mission. The
_lordship over sufferers_ is his kingdom, to that points his instinct,
in that he finds his own special art, his master-skill, his kind of
happiness. He must himself be sick, he must be kith and kin to the
sick and the abortions so as to understand them, so as to arrive at an
understanding with them; but he must also be strong, even more master
of himself than of others, impregnable, forsooth, in his will for
power, so as to acquire the trust and the awe of the weak, so that he
can be their hold, bulwark, prop, compulsion, overseer, tyrant, god.
He has to protect them, protect his herds--_against_ whom? Against
the healthy, doubtless also against the envy towards the healthy. He
must be the natural adversary and _scorner_ of every rough, stormy,
reinless, hard, violently-predatory health and power. The priest is
the first form of the more delicate animal that scorns more easily
than it hates. He will not be spared the waging of war with the beasts
of prey, a war of guile (of "spirit") rather than of force, as is
self-evident--he will in certain cases find it necessary to conjure up
out of himself, or at any rate to represent practically a new type of
the beast of prey--a new animal monstrosity in which the polar bear,
the supple, cold, crouching panther, and, not least important, the fox,
are joined together in a trinity as fascinating as it is fearsome.
If necessity exacts it, then will he come on the scene with bearish
seriousness, venerable, wise, cold, full of treacherous superiority, as
the herald and mouthpiece of mysterious powers, sometimes going among
even the other kind of beasts of prey, determined as he is to sow on
their soil, wherever he can, suffering, discord, self-contradiction,
and only too sure of his art, always to be lord of _sufferers_ at all
times. He brings with him, doubtless, salve and balsam; but before he
can play the physician he must first wound; so, while he soothes the
pain which the wound makes, _he at the same time poisons the wound_.
Well versed is he in this above all things, is this wizard and wild
beast tamer, in whose vicinity everything healthy must needs become
ill, and everything ill must needs become tame. He protects, in sooth,
his sick herd well enough, does this strange herdsman; he protects
them also against themselves, against the sparks (even in the centre
of the herd) of wickedness, knavery, malice, and all the other ills
that the plaguey and the sick are heir to; he fights with cunning,
hardness, and stealth against anarchy and against the ever imminent
break-up inside the herd, where _resentment_, that most dangerous
blasting-stuff and explosive, ever accumulates and accumulates. Getting
rid of this blasting-stuff in such a way that it does not blow up the
herd and the herdsman, that is his real feat, his supreme utility;
if you wish to comprise in the shortest formula the value of the
priestly life, it would be correct to say the priest is the _diverter
of the course of resentment_. Every sufferer, in fact, searches
instinctively for a cause of his suffering; to put it more exactly,
a doer,--to put it still more precisely, a sentient _responsible_
doer,--in brief, something living, on which, either actually or in
_effigie_, he can on any pretext vent his emotions. For the venting
of emotions is the sufferer's greatest attempt at alleviation, that
is to say, _stupefaction_, his mechanically desired narcotic against
pain of any kind. It is in this phenomenon alone that is found,
according to my judgment, the real physiological cause of resentment,
revenge, and their family is to be found--that is, in a demand for the
_deadening of pain through emotion_: this cause is generally, but in
my view very erroneously, looked for in the defensive parry of a bare
protective principle of reaction, of a "reflex movement" in the case
of any sudden hurt and danger, after the manner that a decapitated
frog still moves in order to get away from a corrosive acid. But the
difference is fundamental. In one case the object is to prevent being
hurt any more; in the other case the object is to _deaden_ a racking,
insidious, nearly unbearable pain by a more violent emotion of any
kind whatsoever, and at any rate for the time being to drive it out of
the consciousness--for this purpose an emotion is needed, as wild an
emotion as possible, and to excite that emotion some excuse or other
is needed. "It must be somebody's fault that I feel bad"--this kind of
reasoning is peculiar to all invalids, and is but the more pronounced,
the more ignorant they remain of the real cause of their feeling bad,
the physiological cause (the cause may lie in a disease of the _nervus
sympathicus_, or in an excessive secretion of bile, or in a want of
sulphate and phosphate of potash in the blood, or in pressure in the
bowels which stops the circulation of the blood, or in degeneration of
the ovaries, and so forth). Ail sufferers have an awful resourcefulness
and ingenuity in finding excuses for painful emotions; they even
enjoy their jealousy, their broodings over base actions and apparent
injuries, they burrow through the intestines of their past and present
in their search for obscure mysteries, wherein they will be at liberty
to wallow in a torturing suspicion and get drunk on the venom of their
own malice--they tear open the oldest wounds, they make themselves
bleed from the scars which have long been healed, they make evil-doers
out of friends, wife, child, and everything which is nearest to them.
"I suffer: it must be somebody's fault"--so thinks every sick sheep.
But his herdsman, the ascetic priest, says to him, "Quite so, my sheep,
it must be the fault of some one; but thou thyself art that some one,
it is all the fault of thyself alone--_it is the fault of thyself alone
against thyself_": that is bold enough, false enough, but one thing is
at least attained; thereby, as I have said, the course of resentment
is--_diverted_.


16.

You can see now what the remedial instinct of life has at least _tried_
to effect, according to my conception, through the ascetic priest,
and the purpose for which he had to employ a temporary tyranny of
such paradoxical and anomalous ideas as "guilt," "sin," "sinfulness,"
"corruption," "damnation." What was done was to make the sick
_harmless_ up to a certain point, to destroy the incurable by means of
themselves, to turn the milder cases severely on to themselves, to give
their resentment a backward direction ("man needs but one thing"), and
to _exploit_ similarly the bad instincts of all sufferers with a view
to self-discipline, self-surveillance, self-mastery. It is obvious that
there can be no question at all in the case of a "medication" of this
kind, a mere emotional medication, of any real _healing_ of the sick in
the physiological sense; it cannot even for a moment be asserted that
in this connection the instinct of life has taken healing as its goal
and purpose. On the one hand, a kind of congestion and organisation of
the sick (the word "Church" is the most popular name for it): on the
other, a kind of provisional safeguarding of the comparatively healthy,
the more perfect specimens, the cleavage of a _rift_ between healthy
and sick--for a long time that was all! and it was much! it was very
much!

I am proceeding, as you see, in this essay, from an hypothesis which,
as far as such readers as I want are concerned, does not require to be
proved; the hypothesis that "sinfulness" in man is not an actual fact,
but rather merely the interpretation of a fact, of a physiological
discomfort,--a discomfort seen through a moral religious perspective
which is no longer binding upon us. The fact, therefore, that any one
feels "guilty," "sinful," is certainly not yet any proof that he is
right in feeling so, any more than any one is healthy simply because
he feels healthy. Remember the celebrated witch-ordeals: in those days
the most acute and humane judges had no doubt but that in these cases
they were confronted with guilt,--the "witches"_ themselves had no
doubt on the point_,--and yet the guilt was lacking. Let me elaborate
this hypothesis: I do not for a minute accept the very "pain in the
soul" as a real fact, but only as an explanation (a casual explanation)
of facts that could not hitherto be precisely formulated; I regard
it therefore as something as yet absolutely in the air and devoid of
scientific cogency--just a nice fat word in the place of a lean note
of interrogation. When any one fails to get rid of his "pain in the
soul," the cause is, speaking crudely, to be found _not_ in his "soul"
but more probably in his stomach (speaking crudely, I repeat, but by
no means wishing thereby that you should listen to me or understand
me in a crude spirit). A strong and well-constituted man digests his
experiences (deeds and misdeeds all included) just as he digests his
meats, even when he has some tough morsels to swallow. If he fails to
"relieve himself" of an experience, this kind of indigestion is quite
as much physiological as the other indigestion--and indeed, in more
ways than one, simply one of the results of the other. You can adopt
such a theory, and yet _entre nous_ be nevertheless the strongest
opponent of all materialism.


17.

But is he really a _physician_, this ascetic priest? We already
understand why we are scarcely allowed to call him a physician, however
much he likes to feel a "saviour" and let himself be worshipped as a
saviour.[3] It is only the actual suffering, the discomfort of the
sufferer, which he combats, _not_ its cause, not the actual state of
sickness--this needs must constitute our most radical objection to
priestly medication. But just once put yourself into that point of
view, of which the priests have a monopoly, you will find it hard to
exhaust your amazement, at what from that standpoint he has completely
seen, sought, and found. The _mitigation_ of suffering, every kind of
"consoling"--all this manifests itself as his very genius: with what
ingenuity has he interpreted his mission of consoler, with what aplomb
and audacity has he chosen weapons necessary for the part. Christianity
in particular should be dubbed a great treasure-chamber of ingenious
consolations,--such a store of refreshing, soothing, deadening drugs
has it accumulated within itself; so many of the most dangerous and
daring expedients has it hazarded; with such subtlety, refinement,
Oriental refinement, has it divined what emotional stimulants can
conquer, at any rate for a time, the deep depression, the leaden
fatigue, the black melancholy of physiological cripples--for, speaking
generally, all religions are mainly concerned with fighting a certain
fatigue and heaviness that has infected everything. You can regard it
as _prima facie_ probable that in certain places in the world there
was almost bound to prevail from time to time among large masses of
the population a _sense of physiological depression_, which, however,
owing to their lack of physiological knowledge, did not appear to their
consciousness as such, so that consequently its "cause" and its _cure_
can only be sought and essayed in the science of moral psychology
(this, in fact, is my most general formula for what is generally called
a "_religion_"). Such a feeling of depression can have the most diverse
origins; it may be the result of the crossing of too heterogeneous
races (or of classes--genealogical and racial differences are also
brought out in the classes: the European "Weltschmerz," the "Pessimism"
of the nineteenth century, is really the result of an absurd and sudden
class-mixture); it may be brought about by a mistaken emigration--a
race falling into a climate for which its power of adaptation is
insufficient (the case of the Indians in India); it may be the effect
of old age and fatigue (the Parisian pessimism from 1850 onwards); it
may be a wrong diet (the alcoholism of the Middle Ages, the nonsense
of vegetarianism--which, however, have in their favour the authority
of Sir Christopher in Shakespeare); it may be blood-deterioration,
malaria, syphilis, and the like (German depression after the Thirty
Years' War, which infected half Germany with evil diseases, and
thereby paved the way for German servility, for German pusillanimity).
In such a case there is invariably recourse to a _war_ on a grand scale
with the feeling of depression; let us inform ourselves briefly on its
most important practices and phases (I leave on one side, as stands to
reason, the actual _philosophic_ war against the feeling of depression
which is usually simultaneous--it is interesting enough, but too
absurd, too practically negligible, too full of cobwebs, too much of a
hole-and-corner affair, especially when pain is proved to be a mistake,
on the _naïf_ hypothesis that pain must needs _vanish_ when the mistake
underlying it is recognised--but behold! it does anything but vanish
...). That dominant depression is _primarily fought_ by weapons which
reduce the consciousness of life itself to the lowest degree. Wherever
possible, no more wishes, no more wants; shun everything which produces
emotion, which produces "blood" (eating no salt, the fakir hygiene);
no love; no hate; equanimity; no revenge; no getting rich; no work;
begging; as far as possible, no woman, or as little woman as possible;
as far as the intellect is concerned, Pascal's principle, "_il faut
s'abêtir._" To put the result in ethical and psychological language,
"self-annihilation," "sanctification"; to put it in physiological
language, "hypnotism"--the attempt to find some approximate human
equivalent for what _hibernation_ is for certain animals, for what
_æstivation_ is for many tropical plants, a minimum of assimilation
and metabolism in which life just manages to subsist without really
coming into the consciousness. An amazing amount of human energy
has been devoted to this object--perhaps uselessly? There cannot be
the slightest doubt but that such _sportsmen_ of "saintliness," in
whom at times nearly every nation has abounded, have really found a
genuine relief from that which they have combated with such a rigorous
_training_--in countless cases they really escaped by the help of their
system of hypnotism _away_ from deep physiological depression; their
method is consequently counted among the most universal ethnological
facts. Similarly it is improper to consider such a plan for starving
the physical element and the desires, as in itself a symptom of
insanity (as a clumsy species of roast-beef-eating "freethinkers" and
Sir Christophers are fain to do); all the more certain is it that their
method can and does pave the way to all kinds of mental disturbances,
for instance, "inner lights" (as far as the case of the Hesychasts of
Mount Athos), auditory and visual hallucinations, voluptuous ecstasies
and effervescences of sensualism (the history of St. Theresa). The
explanation of such events given by the victims is always the acme of
fanatical falsehood; this is self-evident. Note well, however, the tone
of implicit gratitude that rings in the very _will_ for an explanation
of such a character. The supreme state, salvation itself, that final
goal of universal hypnosis and peace, is always regarded by them as
the mystery of mysteries, which even the most supreme symbols are
inadequate to express; it is regarded as an entry and homecoming to the
essence of things, as a liberation from all illusions, as "knowledge,"
as "truth," as "being" as an escape from every end, every wish, every
action, as something even beyond Good and Evil.

"Good and Evil," quoth the Buddhists, "both are fetters. The perfect
man is master of them both."

"The done and the undone," quoth the disciple of the Vedanta, "do
him no hurt; the good and the evil he shakes from off him, sage that
he is; his kingdom suffers no more from any act; good and evil, he
goes beyond them both."--An absolutely Indian conception, as much
Brahmanist as Buddhist. Neither in the Indian nor in the Christian
doctrine is this "Redemption" regarded as attainable by means of
virtue and moral improvement, however high they may place the value of
the hypnotic efficiency of virtue: keep clear on this point--indeed
it simply corresponds with the facts. The fact that they remained
_true_ on this point is perhaps to be regarded as the best specimen
of realism in the three great religions, absolutely soaked as they
are with morality, with this one exception. "For those who know,
there is no duty." "Redemption is not attained by the acquisition of
virtues; for redemption consists in being one with Brahman, who is
incapable of acquiring any perfection; and equally little does it
consist in the _giving up of faults_, for the Brahman, unity with whom
is what constitutes redemption, is eternally pure" (these passages
are from the Commentaries of the Cankara, quoted from the first real
European _expert_ of the Indian philosophy, my friend Paul Deussen).
We wish, therefore, to pay honour to the idea of "redemption" in
the great religions, but it is somewhat hard to remain serious in
view of the appreciation meted out to the _deep sleep_ by these
exhausted pessimists who are too tired even to dream--to the deep
sleep considered, that is, as already a fusing into Brahman, as the
attainment of the _unio mystica_ with God. "When he has completely gone
to sleep," says on this point the oldest and most venerable "script,"
"and come to perfect rest, so that he sees no more any vision, then,
oh dear one, is he united with Being, he has entered into his own
self--encircled by the Self with its absolute knowledge, he has no
more any consciousness of that which is without or of that which is
within. Day and night cross not these bridges, nor age, nor death,
nor suffering, nor good deeds, nor evil deeds." "In deep sleep," say
similarly the believers in this deepest of the three great religions,
"does the soul lift itself from out this body of ours, enters the
supreme light and stands out therein in its true shape: therein is it
the supreme spirit itself, which travels about, while it jests and
plays and enjoys itself, whether with women, or chariots, or friends;
there do its thoughts turn no more back to this appanage of a body,
to which the 'prana' (the vital breath) is harnessed like a beast of
burden to the cart." None the less we will take care to realise (as
we did when discussing "redemption") that in spite of all its pomps
of Oriental extravagance this simply expresses the same criticism on
life as did the clear, cold, Greekly cold, but yet suffering Epicurus.
The hypnotic sensation of nothingness, the peace of deepest sleep,
anæsthesia in short––that is what passes with the sufferers and the
absolutely depressed for, forsooth, their supreme good, their value
of values; that is what <b>must</b> be treasured by them as something
positive, be felt by them as the essence of _the_ Positive (according
to the same logic of the feelings, nothingness is in all pessimistic
religions called God).

Such a hypnotic deadening of sensibility and susceptibility to pain,
which presupposes somewhat rare powers, especially courage, contempt
of opinion, intellectual stoicism, is less frequent than another
and certainly easier _training_ which is tried against states of
depression. I mean _mechanical activity_. It is indisputable that a
suffering existence can be thereby considerably alleviated. This fact
is called to-day by the somewhat ignoble title of the "Blessing of
work." The alleviation consists in the attention of the sufferer being
absolutely diverted from suffering, in the incessant monopoly of the
consciousness by action, so that consequently there is little room left
for suffering––for _narrow_ is it, this chamber of human consciousness!
Mechanical activity and its corollaries, such as absolute regularity,
punctilious unreasoning obedience, the chronic routine of life, the
complete occupation of time, a certain liberty to be impersonal, nay, a
training in "impersonality," self-forgetfulness, "_incuria sui_"––with
what thoroughness and expert subtlety have all these methods been
exploited by the ascetic priest in his war with pain!

When he has to tackle sufferers of the lower orders, slaves, or
prisoners (or women, who for the most part are a compound of
labour-slave and prisoner), all he has to do is to juggle a little
with the names, and to rechristen, so as to make them see henceforth
a benefit, a comparative happiness, in objects which they hated--the
slave's discontent with his lot was at any rate not invented by the
priests. An even more popular means of fighting depression is the
ordaining of a _little joy_, which is easily accessible and can be made
into a rule; this medication is frequently used in conjunction with
the former ones. The most frequent form in which joy is prescribed
as a cure is the joy in _producing_ joy (such as doing good, giving
presents, alleviating, helping, exhorting, comforting, praising,
treating with distinction); together with the prescription of "love
your neighbour." The ascetic priest prescribes, though in the most
cautious doses, what is practically a stimulation of the strongest
and most life-assertive impulse--the Will for Power. The happiness
involved in the "smallest superiority" which is the concomitant of all
benefiting, helping, extolling, making one's self useful, is the most
ample consolation, of which, if they are well-advised, physiological
distortions avail themselves: in other cases they hurt each other, and
naturally in obedience to the same radical instinct. An investigation
of the origin of Christianity in the Roman world shows that
co-operative unions for poverty, sickness, and burial sprang up in the
lowest stratum of contemporary society, amid which the chief antidote
against depression, the little joy experienced in mutual benefits,
was deliberately fostered. Perchance this was then a novelty, a real
discovery? This conjuring up of the will for co-operation, for family
organisation, for communal life, for "_Cœnacula_" necessarily brought
the Will for Power, which had been already infinitesimally stimulated,
to a new and much fuller manifestation. The herd organisation is a
genuine advance and triumph in the fight with depression. With the
growth of the community there matures even to individuals a new
interest, which often enough takes him out of the more personal
element in his discontent, his aversion to himself, the "_despectus
sui_" of Geulincx. All sick and diseased people strive instinctively
after a herd-organisation, out of a desire to shake off their sense of
oppressive discomfort and weakness; the ascetic priest divines this
instinct and promotes it; wherever a herd exists it is the instinct
of weakness which has wished for the herd, and the cleverness of the
priests which has organised it, for, mark this: by an equally natural
necessity the strong strive as much for _isolation_ as the weak for
_union_: when the former bind themselves it is only with a view to an
aggressive joint action and joint satisfaction of their Will for Power,
much against the wishes of their individual consciences; the latter,
on the contrary, range themselves together with positive _delight_ in
such a muster--their instincts are as much gratified thereby as the
instincts of the "born master" (that is, the solitary beast-of-prey
species of man) are disturbed and wounded to the quick by organisation.
There is always lurking beneath every oligarchy--such is the
universal lesson of history--the desire for tyranny. Every oligarchy
is continually quivering with the tension of the effort required by
each individual to keep mastering this desire. (Such, _e.g._, was
the Greek; Plato shows it in a hundred places, Plato, who knew his
contemporaries--and _himself_.)


19.

The methods employed by the ascetic priest, which we have already
learnt to know--stifling of all vitality, mechanical energy, the
little joy, and especially the method of "love your neighbour"
herd-organisation, the awaking of the communal consciousness of power,
to such a pitch that the individual's disgust with himself becomes
eclipsed by his delight in the thriving of the community--these are,
according to modern standards, the "innocent" methods employed in
the fight with depression; let us turn now to the more interesting
topic of the "guilty" methods. The guilty methods spell one thing:
to produce _emotional excess_--which is used as the most efficacious
anæsthetic against their depressing state of protracted pain; this
is why priestly ingenuity has proved quite inexhaustible in thinking
out this one question: "_By what means_ can you produce an emotional
excess?" This sounds harsh: it is manifest that it would sound nicer
and would grate on one's ears less, if I were to say, forsooth: "The
ascetic priest made use at all times of the enthusiasm contained in all
strong emotions." But what is the good of still soothing the delicate
ears of our modern effeminates? What is the good _on our side_ of
budging one single inch before their verbal Pecksniffianism. For us
psychologists to do that would be at once _practical Pecksniffianism_,
apart from the fact of its nauseating us. The _good taste_ (others
might say, the righteousness) of a psychologist nowadays consists, if
at all, in combating the shamefully moralised language with which all
modern judgments on men and things are smeared. For, do not deceive
yourself: what constitutes the chief characteristic of modern souls and
of modern books is not the lying, but the _innocence_ which is part
and parcel of their intellectual dishonesty. The inevitable running up
against this "innocence" everywhere constitutes the most distasteful
feature of the somewhat dangerous business which a modern psychologist
has to undertake: it is a part of our great danger--it is a road which
perhaps leads us straight to the great nausea--I know quite well the
purpose which all modern books will and can serve (granted that they
last, which I am not afraid of, and granted equally that there is to
be at some future day a generation with a more rigid, more severe,
and _healthier_ taste)--the _function_ which all modernity generally
will serve with posterity: that of an emetic,--and this by reason of
its moral sugariness and falsity, its ingrained feminism, which it is
pleased to call "Idealism," and at any rate believes to be idealism.
Our cultured men of to-day, our "good" men, do not lie--that is true;
but it does _not_ redound to their honour! The real lie, the genuine,
determined, "honest" lie (on whose value you can listen to Plato) would
prove too tough and strong an article for them by a long way; it would
be asking them to do what people have been forbidden to ask them to do,
to open their eyes to their own selves, and to learn to distinguish
between "true" and "false" in their own selves. The dishonest lie alone
suits them: everything which feels a good man is perfectly incapable of
any other attitude to anything than that of a dishonourable liar, an
absolute liar, but none the less an innocent liar, a blue-eyed liar, a
virtuous liar. These "good men," they are all now tainted with morality
through and through, and as far as honour is concerned they are
disgraced and corrupted for all eternity. Which of them _could stand_ a
further truth "about man"? or, put more tangibly, which of them could
put up with a true biography? One or two instances: Lord Byron composed
a most personal autobiography, but Thomas Moore was "too good" for it;
he burnt his friend's papers. Dr. Gwinner, Schopenhauer's executor, is
said to have done the same; for Schopenhauer as well wrote much about
himself, and perhaps also against himself: (εἰς ἑαντόν). The virtuous
American Thayer, Beethoven's biographer, suddenly stopped his work: he
had come to a certain point in that honourable and simple life, and
could stand it no longer. Moral: What sensible man nowadays writes one
honest word about himself? He must already belong to the Order of Holy
Foolhardiness. We are promised an autobiography of Richard Wagner; who
doubts but that it would be a _clever_ autobiography? Think, forsooth,
of the grotesque horror which the Catholic priest Janssen aroused in
Germany with his inconceivably square and harmless pictures of the
German Reformation; what wouldn't people do if some real psychologist
were to tell us about a genuine Luther, tell us, not with the moralist
simplicity of a country priest or the sweet and cautious modesty of a
Protestant historian, but say with the fearlessness of a Taine, that
springs from force of character and not from a prudent toleration of
force. (The Germans, by the bye, have already produced the classic
specimen of this toleration--they may well be allowed to reckon him as
one of their own, in Leopold Ranke, that born classical advocate of
every _causa fortior_, that cleverest of all the clever opportunists.)


20.

But you will soon understand me.--Putting it shortly, there is reason
enough, is there not, for us psychologists nowadays never getting from
a certain mistrust of out _own selves_? Probably even we ourselves are
still "too good" for our work, probably, whatever contempt we feel
for this popular craze for morality, we ourselves are perhaps none
the less its victims, prey, and slaves; probably it infects even us.
Of what was that diplomat warning us, when he said to his colleagues:
"Let us especially mistrust our first impulses, gentlemen! _they are
almost always good_"? So should nowadays every psychologist talk to
his colleagues. And thus we get back to our problem, which in point
of fact does require from us a certain severity, a certain mistrust
especially against "first impulses." The ascetic ideal in the service
of projected emotional excess:--he who remembers the previous essay
will already partially anticipate the essential meaning compressed
into these above ten words. The thorough unswitching of the human
soul, the plunging of it into terror, frost, ardour, rapture, so as
to free it, as through some lightning shock, from all the smallness
and pettiness of unhappiness, depression, and discomfort: what ways
lead to _this_ goal? And which of these ways does so most safely?...
At bottom all great emotions have this power, provided that they find
a sudden outlet--emotions such as rage, fear, lust, revenge, hope,
triumph, despair, cruelty; and, in sooth, the ascetic priest has had
no scruples in taking into his service the whole pack of hounds that
rage in the human kennel, unleashing now these and now those, with the
same constant object of waking man out of his protracted melancholy,
of chasing away, at any rate for a time, his dull pain, his shrinking
misery, but always under the sanction of a religious interpretation
and justification. This emotional excess has subsequently to be _paid
for_, this is self-evident--it makes the ill more ill--and therefore
this kind of remedy for pain is according to modern standards a
"guilty" kind.

The dictates of fairness, however, require that we should all the
more emphasise the fact that this remedy is applied with _a good
conscience_, that the ascetic priest has prescribed it in the most
implicit belief in its utility and indispensability;--often enough
almost collapsing in the presence of the pain which he created;--that
we should similarly emphasise the fact that the violent physiological
revenges of such excesses, even perhaps the mental disturbances, are
not absolutely inconsistent with the general tenor of this kind of
remedy; this remedy, which, as we have shown previously, is _not_ for
the purpose of healing diseases, but of fighting the unhappiness of
that depression, the alleviation and deadening of which was its object.
The object was consequently achieved. The keynote by which the ascetic
priest was enabled to get every kind of agonising and ecstatic music
to play on the fibres of the human soul--was, as every one knows, the
exploitation of the feeling of "_guilt_." I have already indicated in
the previous essay the origin of this feeling--as a piece of animal
psychology and nothing else: we were thus confronted with the
feeling of "guilt," in its crude state, as it were. It was first in
the hands of the priest, real artist that he was in the feeling of
guilt, that it took shape--oh, what a shape! "Sin"--for that is the
name of the new priestly version of the animal "bad-conscience" (the
inverted cruelty)--has up to the present been the greatest event in the
history of the diseased soul: in "sin" we find the most perilous and
fatal masterpiece of religious interpretation. Imagine man, suffering
from himself, some way or other but at any rate physiologically,
perhaps like an animal shut up in a cage, not clear as to the why and
the wherefore! imagine him in his desire for reasons--reasons bring
relief--in his desire again for remedies, narcotics at last, consulting
one, who knows even the occult--and see, lo and behold, he gets a hint
from his wizard, the ascetic priest, his _first_ hint on the "cause" of
his trouble: he must search for it in _himself_, in his guiltiness, in
a piece of the past, he must understand his very suffering as a _state
of punishment_. He has heard, he has understood, has the unfortunate:
he is now in the plight of a hen round which a line has been drawn. He
never gets out of the circle of lines. The sick man has been turned
into "the sinner"--and now for a few thousand years we never get away
from the sight of this new invalid, of "a sinner"--shall we ever get
away from it?--wherever we just look, everywhere the hypnotic gaze of
the sinner always moving in one direction (in the direction of guilt,
the _only_ cause of suffering); everywhere the evil conscience, this
"_greuliche thier_,"[4] to use Luther's language; everywhere rumination
over the past, a distorted view of action, the gaze of the "green-eyed
monster" turned on all action; everywhere the wilful misunderstanding
of suffering, its transvaluation into feelings of guilt, fear of
retribution; everywhere the scourge, the hairy shirt, the starving
body, contrition; everywhere the sinner breaking himself on the ghastly
wheel of a restless and morbidly eager conscience; everywhere mute
pain, extreme fear, the agony of a tortured heart, the spasms of an
unknown happiness, the shriek for "redemption." In point of fact,
thanks to this system of procedure, the old depression, dullness,
and fatigue were absolutely conquered, life itself became _very_
interesting again, awake, eternally awake, sleepless, glowing, burnt
away, exhausted and yet not tired--such was the figure cut by man,
"the sinner," who was initiated into these mysteries. This grand old
wizard of an ascetic priest fighting with depression--he had clearly
triumphed, _his_ kingdom had come: men no longer grumbled at pain, men
_panted_ after pain: "_More pain!_ More pain!" So for centuries on end
shrieked the demand of his acolytes and initiates. Every emotional
excess which hurt; everything which broke, overthrew, crushed,
transported, ravished; the mystery of torture-chambers, the ingenuity
of hell itself--all this was now discovered, divined, exploited, all
this was at the service of the wizard, all this served to promote the
triumph of his ideal, the ascetic ideal. "_My kingdom is not of this
world_," quoth he, both at the beginning and at the end: had he still
the right to talk like that?--Goethe has maintained that there are only
thirty-six tragic situations: we would infer from that, did we not know
otherwise, that Goethe was no ascetic priest. He--knows more.


21.

So far as all _this_ kind of priestly medicine-mongering, the "guilty"
kind, is concerned, every word of criticism is superfluous. As for the
suggestion that emotional excess of the type, which in these cases
the ascetic priest is fain to order to his sick patients (under the
most sacred euphemism, as is obvious, and equally impregnated with
the sanctity of his purpose), has ever really been of use to any sick
man, who, forsooth, would feel inclined to maintain a proposition of
that character? At any rate, some understanding should be come to as
to the expression "be of use." If you only wish to express that such a
system of treatment has _reformed_ man, I do not gainsay it: I merely
add that "reformed" conveys to my mind as much as "tamed," "weakened,"
"discouraged," "refined," "daintified," "emasculated" (and thus it
means almost as much as injured). But when you have to deal principally
with sick, depressed, and oppressed creatures, such a system, even
granted that it makes the ill "better," under any circumstances also
makes them more _ill_: ask the mad-doctors the invariable result of a
methodical application of penance-torture, contrition, and salvation
ecstasies. Similarly ask history. In every body politic where the
ascetic priest has established this treatment of the sick, disease has
on every occasion spread with sinister speed throughout its length
and breadth. What was always the "result"? A shattered nervous system,
in addition to the existing malady, and this in the greatest as in the
smallest, in the individuals as in masses. We find, in consequence of
the penance and redemption-training, awful epileptic epidemics, the
greatest known to history, such as the St. Vitus and St. John dances
of the Middle Ages; we find, as another phase of its after-effect,
frightful mutilations and chronic depressions, by means of which the
temperament of a nation or a city (Geneva, Bale) is turned once for
all into its opposite;--this _training_, again, is responsible for
the witch-hysteria, a phenomenon analogous to somnambulism (eight
great epidemic outbursts of this only between 1564 and 1605);--we
find similarly in its train those delirious death-cravings of large
masses, whose awful "shriek," "_evviva la morte!_" was heard over the
whole of Europe, now interrupted by voluptuous variations and anon by
a rage for destruction, just as the same emotional sequence with the
same intermittencies and sudden changes is now universally observed
in every case where the ascetic doctrine of sin scores once more a
great success (religious neurosis _appears_ as a manifestation of the
devil, there is no doubt of it. What is it? _Quæritur_). Speaking
generally, the ascetic ideal and its sublime-moral cult, this most
ingenious, reckless, and perilous systematisation of all methods of
emotional excess, is writ large in a dreadful and unforgettable fashion
on the whole history of man, and unfortunately not only on history.
I was scarcely able to put forward any other element which attacked
the health and race efficiency of Europeans with more destructive
power than did this ideal; it can be dubbed,without exaggeration,
_the real fatality_ in the history of the health of the European man.
At the most you can merely draw a comparison with the specifically
German influence: I mean the alcohol poisoning of Europe, which up
to the present has kept pace exactly with the political and racial
pre–dominance of the Germans (where they inoculated their blood,
there too did they inoculate their vice). Third in the series comes
syphilis--_magno sed proximo intervallo_.


22.

The ascetic priest has, wherever he has obtained the mastery, corrupted
the health of the soul, he has consequently also corrupted _taste in
artibus et litteris_--he corrupts it still. "Consequently?" I hope I
shall be granted this "consequently "; at any rate, I am not going to
prove it first. One solitary indication, it concerns the arch-book of
Christian literature, their real model, their "book-in-itself." In the
very midst of the Græco-Roman splendour, which was also a splendour
of books, face to face with an ancient world of writings which had
not yet fallen into decay and ruin, at a time when certain books were
still to be read, to possess which we would give nowadays half our
literature in exchange, at that time the simplicity and vanity of
Christian agitators (they are generally called Fathers of the Church)
dared to declare: "We too have our classical literature, we _do not
need that of the Greeks_"--and meanwhile they proudly pointed to their
books of legends, their letters of apostles, and their apologetic
tractlets, just in the same way that to-day the English "Salvation
Army" wages its fight against Shakespeare and other "heathens" with
an analogous literature. You already guess it, I do not like the "New
Testament"; it almost upsets me that I stand so isolated in my taste
so far as concerns this valued, this over-valued Scripture; the taste
of two thousand years is _against_ me; but what boots it! "Here I
stand! I cannot help myself"[5]--I have the courage of my bad taste.
The Old Testament--yes, that is something quite different, all honour
to the Old Testament! I find therein great men, an heroic landscape,
and one of the rarest phenomena in the world, the incomparable naïveté
_of the strong heart_; further still, I find a people. In the New, on
the contrary, just a hostel of petty sects, pure rococo of the soul,
twisting angles and fancy touches, nothing but conventicle air, not to
forget an occasional whiff of bucolic sweetness which appertains to the
epoch (_and_ the Roman province) and is less Jewish than Hellenistic.
Meekness and braggadocio cheek by jowl; an emotional garrulousness
that almost deafens; passionate hysteria, but no passion; painful
pantomime; here manifestly every one lacked good breeding. How dare any
one make so much fuss about their little failings as do these pious
little fellows! No one cares a straw about it--let alone God. Finally
they actually wish to have "the crown of eternal life," do all these
little provincials! In return for what, in sooth? For what end? It is
impossible to carry insolence any further. An immortal Peter! who could
stand _him_! They have an ambition which makes one laugh: the _thing_
dishes up cut and dried his most personal life, his melancholies, and
common-or-garden troubles, as though the Universe itself were under
an obligation to bother itself about them, for it never gets tired of
wrapping up God Himself in the petty misery in which its troubles are
involved. And how about the atrocious form of this chronic hobnobbing
with God? This Jewish, and not merely Jewish, slobbering and clawing
importunacy towards God!--There exist little despised "heathen nations"
in East Asia, from whom these first Christians could have learnt
something worth learning, a little tact in worshiping; these nations
do not allow themselves to say aloud the name of their God. This seems
to me delicate enough, it is certain that it is _too_ delicate, and
not only for primitive Christians; to take a contrast, just recollect
Luther, the most "eloquent" and insolent peasant whom Germany has had,
think of the Lutherian tone, in which he felt quite the most in his
element during his _tête-à-têtes_ with God. Luther's opposition to the
mediæval saints of the Church (in particular, against "that devil's
hog, the Pope"), was, there is no doubt, at bottom the opposition of
a boor, who was offended at the _good etiquette_ of the Church, that
worship-etiquette of the sacerdotal code, which only admits to the
holy of holies the initiated and the silent, and shuts the door against
the boors. These definitely were not to be allowed a hearing in this
planet--but Luther the peasant simply wished it otherwise; as it was,
it was not German enough for him. He personally wished himself to talk
direct, to talk personally, to talk "straight from the shoulder" with
his God. Well, he's done it. The ascetic ideal, you will guess, was at
no time and in no place, a school of good taste, still less of good
manners--at the best it was a school for sacerdotal manners: that is,
it contains in itself something which was a deadly enemy to all good
manners. Lack of measure, opposition to measure, it is itself a "_non
plus ultra_."


23.

The ascetic ideal has corrupted not only health and taste, there are
also third, fourth, fifth, and sixth things which it has corrupted--I
shall take care not to go through the catalogue (when should I get to
the end?). I have here to expose not what this ideal effected; but
rather only what it _means_, on what it is based, what lies lurking
behind it and under it, that of which it is the provisional expression,
an obscure expression bristling with queries and misunderstandings.
And with _this_ object only in view I presumed "not to spare" my
readers a glance at the awfulness of its results, a glance at its
fatal results; I did this to prepare them for the final and most
awful aspect presented to me by the question of the significance of
that ideal. What is the significance of the _power_ of that ideal,
the monstrousness of its power? Why is it given such an amount of
scope? Why is not a better resistance offered against it? The ascetic
ideal expresses one will: where is the opposition will, in which an
opposition ideal expresses itself? The ascetic ideal has an aim--
this goal is, putting it generally, that all the other interests of
human life should, measured by its standard, appear petty and narrow;
it explains epochs, nations, men, in reference to this one end; it
forbids any other interpretation, any other end; it repudiates, denies,
affirms, confirms, only in the sense of its own interpretation (and was
there ever a more thoroughly elaborated system of interpretation?);
it subjects itself to no power, rather does it believe in its own
precedence over every power--it believes that nothing powerful exists
in the world that has not first got to receive from "it" a meaning,
a right to exist, a value, as being an instrument in its work, a
way and means to its end, to one end. Where is the _counterpart_ of
this complete system of will, end, and interpretation? Why is the
counterpart lacking? Where is the other "one aim"? But I am told it
is not lacking, that not only has it fought a long and fortunate fight
with that ideal, but that further it has already won the mastery over
that ideal in all essentials: let our whole modern _science_ attest
this--that modern science, which, like the genuine reality-philosophy
which it is, manifestly believes in itself alone, manifestly has the
courage to be itself, the will to be itself, and has got on well
enough without God, another world, and negative virtues.

With all their noisy agitator-babble, however, they effect nothing with
me; these trumpeters of reality are bad musicians, their voices do
not come from the deeps with sufficient audibility, they are not the
mouthpiece for the abyss of scientific knowledge--for to-day scientific
knowledge is an abyss--the word "science," in such trumpeter-mouths,
is a prostitution, an abuse, an impertinence. The truth is just the
opposite from what is maintained in the ascetic theory. Science has
to-day absolutely no belief in itself, let alone in an ideal superior
to itself, and wherever science still consists of passion, love,
ardour, suffering, it is not the opposition to that ascetic ideal, but
rather the _incarnation of its latest and noblest form_. Does that ring
strange? There are enough brave and decent working people, even among
the learned men of to-day, who like their little corner, and who, just
because they are pleased so to do, become at times indecently loud with
their demand, that people to-day should be quite content, especially
in science--for in science there is so much useful work to do. I do
not deny it--there is nothing I should like less than to spoil the
delight of these honest workers in their handiwork; for I rejoice in
their work. But the fact of science requiring hard work, the fact of
its having contented workers, is absolutely no proof of science as a
whole having to-day one end, one will, one ideal, one passion for a
great faith; the contrary, as I have said, is the case. When science
is not the latest manifestation of the ascetic ideal--but these are
cases of such rarity, selectness, and exquisiteness, as to preclude the
general judgment being affected thereby--science is a _hiding-place_
for every kind of cowardice, disbelief, remorse, _despectio sui_, bad
conscience--it is the very _anxiety_ that springs from having no ideal,
the suffering from the _lack_ of a great love, the discontent with an
enforced moderation. Oh, what does all science not cover to-day? How
much, at any rate, does it not try to cover? The diligence of our best
scholars, their senseless industry, their burning the candle of their
brain at both ends--their very mastery in their handiwork--how often is
the real meaning of all that to prevent themselves continuing to see a
certain thing? Science as a self-anæsthetic: _do you know that_? You
wound them--every one who consorts with scholars experiences this--you
wound them sometimes to the quick through just a harmless word; when
you think you are paying them a compliment you embitter them beyond all
bounds, simply because you didn't have the _finesse_ to infer the real
kind of customers you had to tackle, the _sufferer_ kind (who won't own
up even to themselves what they really are), the dazed and unconscious
kind who have only one fear--_coming to consciousness_.

And now look at the other side, at those rare cases, of which I spoke,
the most supreme idealists to be found nowadays among philosophers and
scholars. Have we, perchance, found in them the sought-for _opponents_
of the ascetic ideal, its _anti-idealists_? In fact, they _believe_
themselves to be such, these "unbelievers" (for they are all of them
that): it seems that this idea is their last remnant of faith, the idea
of being opponents of this ideal, so earnest are they on this subject,
so passionate in word and gesture;--but does it follow that what
they believe must necessarily be _true_? We "knowers" have grown by
degrees suspicious of all kinds of believers, our suspicion has step by
step habituated us to draw just the opposite conclusions to what people
have drawn before; that is to say, wherever the strength of a belief
is particularly prominent to draw the conclusion of the difficulty of
proving what is believed, the conclusion of its actual _improbability_.
We do not again deny that "faith produces salvation": _for that very
reason_ we do deny that faith _proves_ anything,--a strong faith, which
produces happiness, causes suspicion of the object of that faith, it
does not establish its "truth," it does establish a certain probability
of--_illusion_. What is now the position in these cases? These
solitaries and deniers of to-day; these fanatics in one thing, in their
claim to intellectual cleanness; these hard, stern, continent, heroic
spirits, who constitute the glory of our time; all these pale atheists,
anti-Christians, immoralists, Nihilists; these sceptics, "ephectics,"
and "hectics" of the intellect (in a certain sense they are the
latter, both collectively and individually); these supreme idealists
of knowledge, in whom alone nowadays the intellectual conscience
dwells and is alive--in point of fact they believe themselves as far
away as possible from the ascetic ideal, do these "free, very free
spirits": and yet, if I may reveal what they themselves cannot see--for
they stand too near themselves: this ideal is simply _their_ ideal,
they represent it nowadays and perhaps no one else, they themselves
are its most spiritualised product, its most advanced picket of
skirmishers and scouts, its most insidious delicate and elusive form
of seduction.--If I am in any way a reader of riddles, then I will
be one with this sentence: for some time past there have been no
free spirits; _for they still believe in truth_. When the Christian
Crusaders in the East came into collision with that invincible order
of assassins, that order of free spirits _par excellence_, whose
lowest grade lives in a state of discipline such as no order of monks
has ever attained, then in some way or other they managed to get an
inkling of that symbol and tally-word, that was reserved for the
highest grade alone as their _secretum_, "Nothing is true, everything
is allowed,"--in sooth, that was _freedom_ of thought, thereby was
_taking leave_ of the very belief in truth. Has indeed any European,
any Christian freethinker, ever yet wandered into this proposition
and its labyrinthine consequences? Does he know _from experience_ the
Minotauros of this den.--I doubt it--nay, I know otherwise. Nothing
is more really alien to these "mono-fanatics," these _so-called_
"free spirits," than freedom and unfettering in that sense; in no
respect are they more closely tied, the absolute fanaticism of their
belief in truth is unparalleled. I know all this perhaps too much from
experience at close quarters--that dignified philosophic abstinence
to which a belief like that binds its adherents, that stoicism of
the intellect, which eventually vetoes negation as rigidly as it does
affirmation, that wish for standing still in front of the actual,
the _factum brutum_, that fatalism in "_petits faits_" (ce petit
faitalism, as I call it), in which French Science now attempts a kind
of moral superiority over German, this renunciation of interpretation
generally (that is, of forcing, doctoring, abridging, omitting,
suppressing, inventing, falsifying, and all the other _essential_
attributes of interpretation)--all this, considered broadly, expresses
the asceticism of virtue, quite as efficiently as does any repudiation
of the senses (it is at bottom only a _modus_ of that repudiation.)
But what forces it into that unqualified will for truth is the faith
_in the ascetic ideal itself_, even though it take the form of its
unconscious imperatives,--make no mistake about it, it is the faith,
I repeat, in a _metaphysical_ value, an _intrinsic_ value of truth,
of a character which is only warranted and guaranteed in this ideal
(it stands and falls with that ideal). Judged strictly, there does
not exist a science without its "hypotheses," the thought of such a
science is inconceivable, illogical: a philosophy, a faith, must always
exist first to enable science to gain thereby a direction, a meaning,
a limit and method, a _right_ to existence. (He who holds a contrary
opinion on the subject--he, for example, who takes it upon himself to
establish philosophy "upon a strictly scientific basis"--has first got
to "turn up-side-down" not only philosophy but also truth itself--the
gravest insult which could possibly be offered to two such respectable
females!) Yes, there is no doubt about it--and here I quote my _Joyful
Wisdom_, cp. Book V. Aph. 344: "The man who is truthful in that
daring and extreme fashion, which is the presupposition of the faith
in science, _asserts thereby a different world_ from that of life,
nature, and history; and in so far as he asserts the existence of that
different world, come, must he not similarly repudiate its counterpart,
this world, _our_ world? The belief on which our faith in science is
based has remained to this day a metaphysical belief--even we knowers
of to-day, we godless foes of metaphysics, we too take our fire from
that conflagration which was kindled by a thousand-year-old faith,
from that Christian belief, which was also Plato's belief, the belief
that God is truth, that truth is _divine_.... But what if this belief
becomes more and more incredible, what if nothing proves itself to
be divine, unless it be error, blindness, lies--what if God, Himself
proved Himself to be our _oldest lie_?"--It is necessary to stop at
this point and to consider the situation carefully. Science itself now
_needs_ a justification (which is not for a minute to say that there
is such a justification). Turn in this context to the most ancient and
the most modern philosophers: they all fail to realise the extent of
the need of a justification on the part of the Will for Truth--here
is a gap in every philosophy--what is it caused by? Because up to the
present the ascetic ideal dominated all philosophy, because Truth was
fixed as Being, as God, as the Supreme Court of Appeal, because Truth
was not allowed to be a problem. Do you understand this "allowed"?
From the minute that the belief in the God of the ascetic ideal is
repudiated, there exists _a new problem_: the problem of the value of
truth. The Will for Truth needed a critique--let us define by these
words our own task---the value of truth is tentatively _to be called
in question_.... (If this seems too laconically expressed, I recommend
the reader to peruse again that passage from the _Joyful Wisdom_ which
bears the title, "How far we also are still pious," Aph. 344, and best
of all the whole fifth book of that work, as well as the Preface to
_The Dawn of Day_.)

No! You can't get round me with science, when I search for the natural
antagonists of the ascetic ideal, when I put the question: "_Where_
is the opposed will in which the _opponent ideal_ expresses itself?"
Science is not, by a long way, independent enough to fulfil this
function; in every department science needs an ideal value, a power
which creates values, and in whose _service_ it _can believe_ in itself
--science itself never creates values. Its relation to the ascetic
ideal is not in itself antagonistic; speaking roughly, it rather
represents the progressive force in the inner evolution of that ideal.
Tested more exactly, its opposition and antagonism are concerned not
with the ideal itself, but only with that ideal's outworks, its outer
garb, its masquerade, with its temporary hardening, stiffening, and
dogmatising--it makes the life in the ideal free once more, while it
repudiates its superficial elements. These two phenomena, science and
the ascetic ideal, both rest on the same basis––I have already made
this clear––the basis, I say, oft the same over-appreciation of truth
(more accurately the same belief in the _impossibility_ of valuing and
of criticising truth), and consequently they are _necessarily_ allies,
so that, in the event of their being attacked, they must always be
attacked and called into question together. A valuation of the ascetic
ideal inevitably entails a valuation of science as well; lose no time
in seeing this clearly, and be sharp to catch it! (_Art_, I am speaking
provisionally, for I will treat it on some other occasion in greater
detail,––art, I repeat, in which lying is sanctified and the _will for
deception_ has good conscience on its side, is much more fundamentally
opposed to the ascetic ideal than is science: Plato's instinct felt
this––Plato, the greatest enemy of art which Europe has produced up
to the present. Plato _versus_ Homer, that is the complete, the true
antagonism––on the one side, the whole–hearted "transcendental," the
great defamer of life; on the other, its involuntary panegyrist, the
_golden_ nature. An artistic subservience to the service of the ascetic
ideal is consequently the most absolute artistic _corruption_ that
there can be, though unfortunately it is one of the most frequent
phases, for nothing is more corruptible than an artist.) Considered
physiologically, moreover, science rests on the same, basis as
does the ascetic ideal: a certain _impoverishment of life_ is the
presupposition of the latter as of the former––add, frigidity of the
emotions, slackening of the _tempo_, the substitution of dialectic for
instinct, _seriousness_ impressed on mien and gesture (seriousness,
that most unmistakable sign of strenuous metabolism, of struggling,
toiling life). Consider the periods in a nation in which the learned
man comes into prominence; they are the periods of exhaustion, often
of sunset, of decay--the effervescing strength, the confidence in
life, the confidence in the future are no more. The preponderance of
the mandarins never signifies any good, any more than does the advent
of democracy, or arbitration instead of war, equal rights for women,
the religion of pity, and all the other symptoms of declining life.
(Science handled as a problem! what is the meaning of science?--upon
this point the Preface to the _Birth of Tragedy_.) No! this "modern
science"--mark you this well--is at times the _best_ ally for the
ascetic ideal, and for the very reason that it is the ally which is
most unconscious, most automatic, most secret, and most subterranean!
They have been playing into each other's hands up to the present, have
these "poor in spirit" and the scientific opponents of that ideal (take
care, by the bye, not to think that these opponents are the antithesis
of this ideal, that they are the _rich_ in spirit--that they are _not_;
I have called them the _hectic_ in spirit). As for these celebrated
victories of science; there is no doubt that they are _victories_--but
victories over what? There was not for a single minute any victory
among their list over the ascetic ideal, rather was it made stronger,
that is to say, more elusive, more abstract, more insidious, from
the fact that a wall, an outwork, that had got built on to the main
fortress and disfigured its appearance, should from time to time be
ruthlessly destroyed and broken down by science. Does any one seriously
suggest that the downfall of the theological astronomy signified the
downfall of that ideal?--Has, perchance, man grown _less in need_ of a
transcendental solution of his riddle of existence, because since that
time this existence has become more random, casual, and superfluous in
the _visible_ order of the universe? Has there not been since the time
of Copernicus an unbroken progress in the self-belittling of man and
his _will_ for belittling himself? Alas, his belief in his dignity, his
uniquenesses irreplaceableness in the scheme of existence, is gone--he
has become animal, literal, unqualified, and unmitigated animal, he
who in his earlier belief was almost God ("child of God," "demi-God").
Since Copernicus man seems to have fallen on to a steep plane--he rolls
faster and faster away from the centre--whither? into nothingness?
into the "thrilling sensation of his own nothingness"--Well! this
would be the straight way--to the old ideal?--All science (and by no
means only astronomy, with regard to the humiliating and deteriorating
effect of which Kant has made a remarkable confession, "it annihilates
my own importance"), all science, natural as much as _unnatural_--by
unnatural I mean the self-critique of reason--nowadays sets out to
talk man out of his present opinion of himself, as though that opinion
had been nothing but a bizarre piece of conceit; you might go so far
as to say that science finds its peculiar pride, its peculiar bitter
form of stoical ataraxia, in preserving man's _contempt of himself_,
that state which it took so much trouble to bring about, as man's final
and most serious claim to self-appreciation (rightly so, in point
of fact, for he who despises is always "one who has not forgotten
how to appreciate"). But does all this involve any real effort to
_counteract_ the ascetic ideal? Is it really seriously suggested that
Kant's _victory_ over the theological dogmatism about "God," "Soul,"
"Freedom," "Immortality," has damaged that ideal in any way (as the
theologians have imagined to be the case for a long time past)?––
And in this connection it does not concern us for a single minute,
if Kant himself intended any such consummation. It is certain that
from the time of Kant every type of transcendentalist is playing a
winning game––they are emancipated from the theologians; what luck!––he
has revealed to them that secret art, by which they can now pursue
their "heart's desire" on their own responsibility, and with all the
respectability of science. Similarly, who can grumble at the agnostics,
reverers, as they are, of the unknown and the absolute mystery, if they
now worship _their very query_ as God? (Xaver Doudan talks somewhere
of the _ravages_ which _l'habitude d'admirer l'inintelligible au lieu
de rester tout simplement dans l'inconnu_ has produced––the ancients,
he thinks, must have been exempt from those ravages.) Supposing that
everything, "known" to man, fails to satisfy his desires, and on the
contrary contradicts and horrifies them, what a divine way out of all
this to be able to look for the responsibility, not in the "desiring"
but in "knowing"!––"There is no knowledge. _Consequently_––there is
a God"; what a novel _elegantia syllogism_i! what a triumph for the
ascetic ideal!


26.

Or, perchance, does the whole of modern history show in its demeanour
greater confidence in life, greater confidence in its ideals? Its
loftiest pretension is now to be a _mirror_; it repudiates all
teleology; it will have no more "proving"; it disdains to play the
judge, and thereby shows its good taste––it asserts as little as it
denies, it fixes, it "describes." All this is to a high degree ascetic,
but at the same time it is to a much greater degree _nihilistic_; make
no mistake about this! You see in the historian a gloomy, hard, but
determined gaze,––an eye that _looks out_ as an isolated North Pole
explorer looks out (perhaps so as not to look within, so as not to look
back?)––there is snow––here is life silenced, the last crows which
caw here are called "whither?" "Vanity," "Nada"––here nothing more
flourishes and grows, at the most the metapolitics of St. Petersburg
and the "pity" of Tolstoi. But as for that other school of historians,
a perhaps still more "modern" school, a voluptuous and lascivious
school which ogles life and the ascetic ideal with equal fervour,
which uses the word "artist" as a glove, and has nowadays established
a "corner" for itself, in all the praise given to contemplation; oh,
what a thirst do these sweet intellectuals excite even for ascetics
and winter landscapes! Nay! The devil take these "contemplative" folk!
How much liefer would I wander with those historical Nihilists through
the gloomiest, grey, cold mist!––nay, I shall not mind listening
(supposing I have to choose) to one who is completely unhistorical
and anti-historical (a man, like Dühring for instance, over whose
periods a hitherto shy and unavowed species of "beautiful souls" has
grown intoxicated in contemporary Germany, _the species anarchistica_
within the educated proletariate). The "contemplative" are a hundred
times worse––I never knew anything which produced such intense
nausea as one of those "objective" _chairs_,[6] one of those scented
mannikins-about-town of history, a thing half-priest, half-satyr (Renan
_parfum_), which betrays by the high, shrill falsetto of his applause
what he lacks and where he lacks it, who betrays where in this case
the Fates have plied their ghastly shears, alas! in too surgeon-like
a fashion! This is distasteful to me, and irritates my patience; let
him keep patient at such sights who has nothing to lose thereby,––such
a sight enrages me, such spectators embitter me against the "play,"
even more than does the play itself (history itself, you understand);
Anacreontic moods imperceptibly come over me. This Nature, who gave
to the steer its horn, to the lion its χάσμ ὀδοντων, for what purpose
did Nature give me my foot?––To kick, by St. Anacreon, and not merely
to run away! To trample on all the worm-eaten "chairs," the cowardly
contemplators, the lascivious eunuchs of history, the flirters with
ascetic ideals, the righteous hypocrites of impotence! All reverence
on my part to the ascetic ideal, _in so far as it is honourable_! So
long as it believes in itself and plays no pranks on us! But I like
not all these coquettish bugs who have an insatiate ambition to smell
of the infinite, until eventually the infinite smells of bugs; I like
not the whited sepulchres with their stagey reproduction of life;
I like not the tired and the used up who wrap themselves in wisdom
and look "objective"; I like not the agitators dressed up as heroes,
who hide their dummy-heads behind the stalking-horse of an ideal; I
like not the ambitious artists who would fain play the ascetic and
the priest, and are at bottom nothing but tragic clowns; I like not,
again, these newest speculators in idealism, the Anti-Semites, who
nowadays roll their eyes in the patent Christian-Aryan-man-of-honour
fashion, and by an abuse of moralist attitudes and agitation dodges, so
cheap as to exhaust any patience, strive to excite all the blockhead
elements in the populace (the invariable success of _every_ kind of
intellectual charlatanism in present-day Germany hangs together with
the almost indisputable and already quite palpable desolation of the
German mind, whose cause I look for in a too exclusive diet, of papers,
politics, beer, and Wagnerian music, not forgetting the condition
precedent of this diet, the national exclusiveness and vanity, the
strong but narrow principle, "Germany, Germany above everything,"[7]
and finally the _paralysis agitans_ of "modern ideas"). Europe
nowadays is, above all, wealthy and ingenious in means of excitement;
it apparently has no more crying necessity than _stimulantia_ and
alcohol. Hence the enormous counterfeiting of ideals, those most fiery
spirits of the mind; hence too the repulsive, evil-smelling, perjured,
pseudo–alcoholic air everywhere. I should like to know how many cargoes
of imitation idealism, of hero-costumes and high falutin' clap-trap,
how many casks of sweetened pity liqueur (Firm: _la religion de la
souffrance_), how many crutches of righteous indignation for the help
of these flat-footed intellects, how many _comedians_ of the Christian
moral ideal would need to-day to be exported from Europe, to enable
its air to smell pure again. It is obvious that, in regard to this
over-production, a new _trade_ possibility lies open; it is obvious
that there is a new business to be done in little ideal idols and
obedient "idealists"--don't pass over this tip! Who has sufficient
courage? We have in _our hands_ the possibility of idealising the whole
earth. But what am I talking about courage? we only need one thing
here--a hand, a free, a very free hand.


27.

Enough! enough! let us leave these curiosities and complexities of
the modern spirit, which excite as much laughter as disgust. Our
problem can certainly do without them, the problem of _meaning_ of
the ascetic ideal--what has it got to do with yesterday or to-day?
those things shall be handled by me more thoroughly and severely in
another connection (under the title "A Contribution to the History of
European Nihilism," I refer for this to a work which I am preparing:
_The Will to Power, an Attempt at a Transvaluation of All Values_).
The only reason why I come to allude to it here is this: the ascetic
ideal has at times, even in the most intellectual sphere, only one
real kind of enemies and _damagers_: these are the comedians of this
ideal--for they awake mistrust. Everywhere otherwise, where the mind
is at work seriously, powerfully, and without counterfeiting, it
dispenses altogether now with an ideal (the popular expression for this
abstinence is "Atheism")--_with the exception of the will for truth_.
But this will, this _remnant_ of an ideal, is, if you will believe me,
that ideal itself in its severest and cleverest formulation, esoteric
through and through, stripped of all outworks, and consequently not so
much its remnant as its _kernel_. Unqualified honest atheism (and its
air only do we breathe, we, the most intellectual men of this age) is
_not_ opposed to that ideal, to the extent that it appears to be; it is
rather one of the final phases of its evolution, one of its syllogisms
and pieces of inherent logic--it is the awe-inspiring catastrophe of
a two-thousand-year training in truth, which finally forbids itself
_the lie of the belief in God_. (The same course of development in
India--quite independently, and consequently of some demonstrative
value--the same ideal driving to the same conclusion the decisive point
reached five hundred years before the European era, or more precisely
at the time of Buddha--it started in the Sankhyam philosophy, and then
this was popularised through Buddha, and made into a religion.)

_What_, I put the question with all strictness, has really _triumphed_
over the Christian God? The answer stands in my _Joyful Wisdom_, Aph.
357: "the Christian morality itself, the idea of truth, taken as it was
with increasing seriousness, the confessor-subtlety of the Christian
conscience translated and sublimated into the scientific conscience
into intellectual cleanness at any price. Regarding Nature as though
it were a proof of the goodness and guardianship of God; interpreting
history in honour of a divine reason, as a constant proof of a moral
order of the world and a moral teleology; explaining our own personal
experiences, as pious men have for long enough explained them, as
though every arrangement, every nod, every single thing were invented
and sent out of love for the salvation of the soul; all this is now
done away with, all this has the conscience _against_ it, and is
regarded by every subtler conscience as disreputable, dishonourable,
as lying, feminism, weakness, cowardice--by means of this severity,
if by means of anything at all, are we, in sooth, _good Europeans_
and heirs of Europe's longest and bravest self-mastery.". .. All
great things go to ruin by reason of themselves, by reason of an act
of self-dissolution: so wills the law of life, the law of necessary
"self-mastery" even in the essence of life--ever is the law-giver
finally exposed to the cry, "_patere legem quam ipse tulisti_"; in
thus wise did Christianity _go to ruin as a dogma_, through its own
morality; in thus wise must Christianity go again to ruin to-day as
a morality--we are standing on the threshold of this event. After
Christian truthfulness has drawn one conclusion after the other, it
finally draws its _strongest conclusion_, its conclusion against
itself; this, however, happens, when it puts the question, "_what is
the meaning of every will for truth?_" And here again do I touch on my
problem, on our problem, my unknown friends (for as yet _I know_ of no
friends): what sense has our whole being, if it does not mean that in
our own selves that will for truth has come to its own consciousness
_as a problem_?---By reason of this attainment of self-consciousness
on the part of the will for truth, morality from henceforward--there
is no doubt about it--goes _to pieces_: this is that great hundred-act
play that is reserved for the next two centuries of Europe, the most
terrible, the most mysterious, and perhaps also the most hopeful of all
plays.


28.

If you except the ascetic ideal, man, the animal man had no meaning.
His existence on earth contained no end; "What is the purpose of man
at all?" was a question without an answer; the _will_ for man and the
world was lacking; behind every great human destiny rang as a refrain
a still greater "Vanity!" The ascetic ideal simply means this: that
something _was lacking_, that a tremendous _void_ encircled man--he did
not know how to justify himself, to explain himself, to affirm himself,
he _suffered_ from the problem of his own meaning. He suffered also in
other ways, he was in the main a _diseased_ animal; but his problem
was not suffering itself, but the lack of an answer to that crying
question, "_To what purpose_ do we suffer?" Man, the bravest animal
and the one most inured to suffering, does _not_ repudiate suffering in
itself: he _wills_ it, he even seeks it out, provided that he is shown
a meaning for it, a _purpose_ of suffering. _Not_ suffering, but the
senselessness of suffering was the curse which till then lay spread
over humanity--_and the ascetic ideal gave it a meaning!_ It was up
till then the only meaning; but any meaning is better than no meaning;
the ascetic ideal was in that connection the _"faute de mieux" par
excellence_ that existed at that time. In that ideal suffering _found
an explanation_; the tremendous gap seemed filled; the door to all
suicidal Nihilism was closed. The explanation--there is no doubt about
it--brought in its train new suffering, deeper, more penetrating, more
venomous, gnawing more brutally into life: it brought all suffering
under the perspective of _guilt_; but in spite of all that--man was
_saved_ thereby, he had a _meaning_, and from henceforth was no more
like a leaf in the wind, a shuttle-cock of chance, of nonsense, he
could now "will" something--absolutely immaterial to what end, to what
purpose, with what means he wished: _the will itself was saved_. It
is absolutely impossible to disguise _what_ in point of fact is made
clear by every complete will that has taken its direction from the
ascetic ideal: this hate of the human, and even more of the animal,
and more still of the material, this horror of the senses, of reason
itself, this fear of happiness and beauty, this desire to get right
away from all illusion, change, growth, death, wishing and even
desiring--all this means--let us have the courage to grasp it--a will
for Nothingness, a will opposed to life, a repudiation of the most
fundamental conditions of life, but it is and remains _a will_!--and
to say at the end that which I said at the beginning--man will wish
_Nothingness_ rather than not wish _at all_.

The Europeans now imagine themselves as representing, in the main, the
highest types of men on earth.


2.

A characteristic of Europeans: inconsistency between word and deed;
the Oriental is true to himself in daily life. How the European has
established colonies is explained by his nature, which resembles that
of a beast of prey.

This inconsistency is explained by the fact that Christianity has
abandoned the class from which it sprang.

This is the difference between us and the Hellenes: their morals grew
up among the governing castes. Thucydides' morals are the same as those
that exploded everywhere with Plato.

Attempts towards honesty at the Renaissance, for example: always for
the benefit of the arts. Michael Angelo's conception of God as the
"Tyrant of the World" was an honest one.


3.

I rate Michael Angelo higher than Raphael, because, through all the
Christian clouds and prejudices of his time, he saw the ideal of a
culture _nobler_ than the Christo-Raphaelian: whilst Raphael truly
and modestly glorified only the values handed down to him, and did
not carry within himself any inquiring, yearning instincts. Michael
Angelo, on the other hand, saw and felt the problem of the law-giver of
new values: the problem of the conqueror made perfect, who first had
to subdue the "hero within himself," the man exalted to his highest
pedestal, master even of his pity, who mercilessly shatters and
annihilates everything that does not bear his own stamp, shining in
Olympian divinity. Michael Angelo was naturally only at certain moments
so high and so far beyond his age and Christian Europe: for the most
part he adopted a condescending attitude towards the eternal feminine
in Christianity; it would seem, indeed, that in the end he broke down
before her, and gave up the ideal of his most inspired hours. It was
an ideal which only a man in the strongest and highest vigour of life
could bear; but not a man advanced in years! Indeed, he would have had
to demolish Christianity with his ideal! But he was not thinker and
philosopher enough for that Perhaps Leonardo da Vinci alone of those
artists had a really super-Christian outlook. He knows the East, the
"land of dawn," within himself as well as without himself. There is
something super-European and silent in him: a characteristic of every
one who has seen too wide a circle of things good and bad.

How much we have learnt and learnt anew in fifty years! The whole
Romantic School with its belief in "the people" is refuted! No Homeric
poetry as "popular" poetry! No deification of the great powers of
Nature! No deduction from language-relationship to race-relationship!
No "intellectual contemplations" of the supernatural! No truth
enshrouded in religion!

The problem of truthfulness is quite a new one. I am astonished. From
this standpoint we regard such natures as Bismarck as culpable out of
carelessness, such as Richard Wagner out of want of modesty; we would
condemn Plato for his _pia fraus_, Kant for the derivation of his
Categorical Imperative, his own belief certainly not having come to him
from this source.

Finally, even doubt turns against itself: doubt in doubt. And the
question as to the _value_ of truthfulness and its extent lies _there_.


5.

What I observe with pleasure in the German is his Mephistophelian
nature; but, to tell the truth, one must have a higher conception of
Mephistopheles than Goethe had, who found it necessary to _diminish_
his Mephistopheles in order to magnify his "inner Faust." The true
German Mephistopheles is much more dangerous, bold, wicked, and
cunning, and consequently more open-hearted: remember the nature
of Frederick the Great, or of that much greater Frederick, the
Hohenstaufen, Frederick II.

The real German Mephistopheles crosses the Alps, and believes that
everything there belongs to him. Then he recovers himself, like
Winckelmann, like Mozart. He looks upon Faust and Hamlet as
caricatures, invented to be laughed at, and upon Luther also. Goethe
had his good German moments, when he laughed inwardly at all these
things. But then he fell back again into his cloudy moods.


6.

Perhaps the Germans have only grown up in a wrong climate! There is
something in them that might be Hellenic!--something that is awakened
when they are brought into touch with the South--Winckelmann, Goethe,
Mozart. We should not forget, however, that we are still young. Luther
is still our last event; our last book is still the Bible. The Germans
have never yet "moralised." Also, the very food of the Germans was
their doom: its consequence, Philistinism.


7.

The Germans are a dangerous people: they are experts at inventing
intoxicants. Gothic, rococo (according to Semper), the historical sense
and exoticism, Hegel, Richard Wagner--Leibniz, too (dangerous at the
present day)--(they even idealised the serving soul as the virtue of
scholars and soldiers, also as the simple mind). The Germans may well
be the most composite people on earth.

"The people of the Middle," the inventors of porcelain, and of a kind
of Chinese breed of Privy Councillor.


8.

The smallness and baseness of the German soul were not and are not
consequences of the system of small states; for it is well known that
the inhabitants of much smaller states were proud and independent:
and it is not a large state _per se_ that makes souls freer and more
manly. The man whose soul obeys the slavish command: "Thou shalt and
must kneel!" in whose body there is an involuntary bowing and scraping
to titles, orders, gracious glances from above--well, such a man
in an "Empire" will only bow all the more deeply and lick the dust
more fervently in the presence of the greater sovereign than in the
presence of the lesser: this cannot be doubted. We can still see in the
lower classes of Italians that aristocratic self-sufficiency; manly
discipline and self-confidence still form a part of the long history
of their country: these are virtues which once manifested themselves
before their eyes. A poor Venetian gondolier makes a far better figure
than a Privy Councillor from Berlin, and is even a better man in the
end--any one can see this. Just ask the women.


9.

Most artists, even some of the greatest (including the historians) have
up to the present belonged to the serving classes (whether they serve
people of high position or princes or women or "the masses"), not to
speak of their dependence upon the Church and upon moral law. Thus
Rubens portrayed the nobility of his age; but only according to their
vague conception of taste, not according to his own measure of beauty
on the whole, therefore, against his own taste. Van Dyck was nobler in
this respect: who in all those whom he painted added a certain amount
of what he himself most highly valued: he did not descend from himself,
but rather lifted up others to himself when he "rendered."

The slavish humility of the artist to his public (as Sebastian Bach has
testified in undying and outrageous words in the dedication of his High
Mass) is perhaps more difficult to perceive in music; but it is all the
more deeply engrained. A hearing would be refused me if I endeavoured
to impart my views on this subject. Chopin possesses distinction, like
Van Dyck. The disposition of Beethoven is that of a proud peasant;
of Haydn, that of a proud servant. Mendelssohn, too, possesses
distinction--like Goethe, in the most natural way in the world.


10.

We could at any time have counted on the fingers of one hand those
German learned men who possessed wit: the remainder have understanding,
and a few of them, happily, that famous "childlike character"
which divines.... It is our privilege: with this "divination" German
science has discovered some things which we can hardly conceive of, and
which, after all, do not exist, perhaps. It is only the Jews among the
Germans who do not "divine" like them.


11.

As Frenchmen reflect the politeness and _esprit_ of French society,
so do Germans reflect something of the deep, pensive earnestness of
their mystics and musicians, and also of their silly childishness. The
Italian exhibits a great deal of republican distinction and art, and
can show himself to be noble and proud without vanity.


12.

A larger number of the higher and better-endowed men will, I hope, have
in the end so much self-restraint as to be able to get rid of their bad
taste for affectation and sentimental darkness, and to turn against
Richard Wagner as much as against Schopenhauer. These two Germans are
leading us to ruin; they flatter our dangerous qualities. A stronger
future is prepared for us in Goethe, Beethoven, and Bismarck than in
these racial aberrations. We have had no philosophers yet.


13.

The peasant is the commonest type of noblesse, for he is dependent upon
himself most of all. Peasant blood is still the best blood in Germany
--for example, Luther, Niebuhr, Bismarck.

Bismarck a Slav. Let any one look upon the face of Germans. Everything
that had manly, exuberant blood in it went abroad. Over the smug
populace remaining, the slave-souled people, there came an improvement
from abroad, especially by a mixture of Slavonic blood.

The Brandenburg nobility and the Prussian nobility in general (and the
peasant of certain North German districts), comprise at present the
most manly natures in Germany.

That the manliest men shall rule: this is only the natural order of
things.


14.

The future of German culture rests with the sons of the Prussian
officers.


15.

There has always been a want of wit in Germany, and mediocre heads
attain there to the highest honours, because even they are rare. What
is most highly prized is diligence and perseverance and a certain
cold-blooded, critical outlook, and, for the sake of such qualities,
German scholarship and the German military system have become paramount
in Europe.


16.

Parliaments may be very useful to a strong and versatile statesman:
he has something there to rely upon (every such thing must, however,
be able to resist!)--upon which he can throw a great deal of
responsibility. On the whole, however, I could wish that the counting
mania and the superstitious belief in majorities were not established
in Germany, as with the Latin races, and that one could finally invent
something new even in politics! It is senseless and dangerous to let
the custom of universal suffrage--which is still but a short time under
cultivation, and could easily be uprooted--take a deeper root: whilst,
of course, its introduction was merely an expedient to steer clear of
temporary difficulties.


17.

Can any one interest himself in this German Empire? Where is the new
thought? Is it only a new combination of power? All the worse, if it
does not know its own mind. Peace and laisser aller are not types of
politics for which I have any respect. Ruling, and helping the highest
thoughts to victory--the only things that can make me interested in
Germany. England's small-mindedness is the great danger now on earth.
I observe more inclination towards greatness in the feelings of the
Russian Nihilists than in those of the English Utilitarians. We require
an intergrowth of the German and Slav races, and we require, too, the
cleverest financiers, the Jews, for us to become masters of the world.

(a) The sense of reality.

(b) A giving-up of the English principle of the people's right of
representation. We require the representation of the great interests.

(c) We require an unconditional union with Russia, together with a
mutual plan of action which shall not permit any English schemata to
obtain the mastery in Russia. No American future!

(d) A national system of politics is untenable, and embarrassment by
Christian views is a very great evil. In Europe all sensible people are
sceptics, whether they say so or not.


18.

I see over and beyond all these national wars, new "empires," and
whatever else lies in the foreground. What I am concerned with--for I
see it preparing itself slowly and hesitatingly--is the United Europe.
It was the only real work, the one impulse in the souls, of all the
broad-minded and deep-thinking men of this century--this preparation
of a new synthesis, and the tentative effort to anticipate the future
of "the European." Only in their weaker moments, or when they grew
old, did they fall back again into the national narrowness of the
"Fatherlanders"--then they were once more "patriots." I am thinking
of men like Napoleon, Heinrich Heine, Goethe, Beethoven, Stendhal,
Schopenhauer. Perhaps Richard Wagner likewise belongs to their number,
concerning whom, as a successful type of German obscurity, nothing can
be said without some such "perhaps."

But to the help of such minds as feel the need of a new unity there
comes a great explanatory economic fact: the small States of Europe--I
refer to all our present kingdoms and "empires"--will in a short time
become economically untenable, owing to the mad, uncontrolled struggle
for the possession of local and international trade. Money is even
now compelling European nations to amalgamate into one Power. In
order, however, that Europe may enter into the battle for the mastery
of the world with good prospects of victory (it is easy to perceive
against whom this battle will be waged), she must probably "come to
an understanding" with England. The English colonies are needed for
this struggle, just as much as modern Germany, to play her new rôle of
broker and middleman, requires the colonial possessions of Holland.
For no one any longer believes that England alone is strong enough to
continue to act her old part for fifty years more; the impossibility
of shutting out _homines novi_ from the government will ruin her, and
her continual change of political parties is a fatal obstacle to the
carrying out of any tasks which require to be spread out over a long
period of time. A man must to-day be a soldier first and foremost that
he may not afterwards lose his credit as a merchant. Enough; here,
as in other matters, the coming century will be found following in
the footsteps of Napoleon--the first man, and the man of greatest
initiative and advanced views, of modern times. For the tasks of the
next century, the methods of popular representation and parliaments are
the most inappropriate imaginable.


19.

The condition of Europe in the next century will once again lead to the
breeding of manly virtues, because men will live in continual danger.
Universal military service is already the curious antidote which we
possess for the effeminacy of democratic ideas, and it has grown up out
of the struggle of the nations. (Nation--men who speak one language
and read the same newspapers. These men now call themselves "nations,"
and would far too readily trace their descent from the same source and
through the same history; which, however, even with the assistance of
the most malignant lying in the past, they have not succeeded in
doing.)


20.

What quagmires and mendacity must there be about if it is possible,
in the modern European hotch-potch, to raise questions of "race"! (It
being premised that the origin of such writers is not in Horneo and
Borneo.)


21.

Maxim: To associate with no man who takes any part in the mendacious
race swindle.


22.

With the freedom of travel now existing, groups of men of the same
kindred can join together and establish communal habits and customs.
The overcoming of "nations."


23.

To make Europe a centre of culture, national stupidities should not
make us blind to the fact that in the higher regions there is already a
continuous reciprocal dependence. France and German philosophy. Richard
Wagner and Paris (1830-50). Goethe and Greece. All things are impelled
towards, a synthesis of the European past in the highest types of mind.


24.

Mankind has still much before it--how, generally speaking, could
the ideal be taken from the past? Perhaps merely in relation to the
present, which latter is possibly a lower region.


25.

This is our distrust, which recurs again and again; our care, which
never lets us sleep; our question, which no one listens to or wishes
to listen to; our Sphinx, near which there is more than one precipice:
we believe that the men of present-day Europe are deceived in regard
to the things which we love best, and a pitiless demon (no, not
pitiless, only indifferent and puerile)--plays with our hearts and
their enthusiasm, as it may perhaps have already played with everything
that lived and loved; I believe that everything which we Europeans
of to-day are in the habit of admiring as the values of all these
respected things called "humanity," "mankind," "sympathy," "pity," may
be of some value as the debilitation and moderating of certain powerful
and dangerous primitive impulses. Nevertheless, in the long run all
these things are nothing else than the belittlement of the entire type
"man," his mediocrisation, if in such a desperate situation I may make
use of such a desperate expression. I think that the commedia umana for
an epicurean spectator-god must consist in this: that the Europeans, by
virtue of their growing morality, believe in all their innocence and
vanity that they are rising higher and higher, whereas the truth is
that they are sinking lower and lower--i.e. through the cultivation of
all the virtues which are useful to a herd, and through the repression
of the other and contrary virtues which give rise to a new, higher,
stronger, masterful race of men--the first-named virtues merely develop
the herd-animal in man and stabilitate the animal "man," for until now
man has been "the animal as yet unstabilitated."


26.

Genius and Epoch.--Heroism is no form of selfishness, for one is
shipwrecked by it.... The direction of power is often conditioned by
the state of the period in which the great man happens to be born; and
this fact brings about the superstition that he is the expression of
his time. But this same power could be applied in several different
ways; and between him and his time there is always this difference:
that public opinion always worships the herd instinct,--_i.e._ the
instinct of the weak,--while he, the strong man, rights for strong
ideals.


27.

The fate now overhanging Europe is simply this: that it is exactly
her strongest sons that come rarely and late to the spring-time of
their existence; that, as a rule, when they are already in their early
youth they perish, saddened, disgusted, darkened in mind, just because
they have already, with the entire passion of their strength, drained
to the dregs the cup of disillusionment, which in our days means the
cup of knowledge, and they would not have been the strongest had
they not also been the most disillusionised. For that is the test of
their power--they must first of all rise out of the illness of their
epoch to reach their own health. A late spring-time is their mark of
distinction; also, let us add, late merriment, late folly, the late
exuberance of joy! For this is the danger of to-day: everything that we
loved when we were young has betrayed us. Our last love--the love which
makes us acknowledge her, our love for Truth--let us take care that

1.

--Let us look each other in the face. We are Hyperboreans--we know well
enough how remote our place is. "Neither by land nor by water will you
find the road to the Hyperboreans": even Pindar,[1] in his day, knew
_that_ much about us. Beyond the North, beyond the ice, beyond
_death_--_our_ life, _our_ happiness.... We have discovered that
happiness; we know the way; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of
years in the labyrinth. Who _else_ has found it?--The man of today?--"I
don't know either the way out or the way in; I am whatever doesn't know
either the way out or the way in"--so sighs the man of today.... _This_
is the sort of modernity that made us ill,--we sickened on lazy peace,
cowardly compromise, the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern Yea and
Nay. This tolerance and _largeur_ of the heart that "forgives"
everything because it "understands" everything is a sirocco to us.
Rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such
south-winds!... We were brave enough; we spared neither ourselves nor
others; but we were a long time finding out _where_ to direct our
courage. We grew dismal; they called us fatalists. _Our_ fate--it was
the fulness, the tension, the _storing up_ of powers. We thirsted for
the lightnings and great deeds; we kept as far as possible from the
happiness of the weakling, from "resignation"... There was thunder in
our air; nature, as we embodied it, became overcast--_for we had not yet
found the way_. The formula of our happiness: a Yea, a Nay, a straight
line, a _goal_....

[1] _Cf._ the tenth Pythian ode. See also the fourth book of Herodotus.
The Hyperboreans were a mythical people beyond the Rhipaean mountains,
in the far North. They enjoyed unbroken happiness and perpetual youth.


2.

What is good?--Whatever augments the feeling of power, the will to
power, power itself, in man.

What is evil?--Whatever springs from weakness.

What is happiness?--The feeling that power _increases_--that resistance
is overcome.

Not contentment, but more power; _not_ peace at any price, but war;
_not_ virtue, but efficiency (virtue in the Renaissance sense, _virtu_,
virtue free of moral acid).

The weak and the botched shall perish: first principle of _our_ charity.
And one should help them to it.

What is more harmful than any vice?--Practical sympathy for the botched
and the weak--Christianity....


3.

The problem that I set here is not what shall replace mankind in the
order of living creatures (--man is an end--): but what type of man must
be _bred_, must be _willed_, as being the most valuable, the most worthy
of life, the most secure guarantee of the future.

This more valuable type has appeared often enough in the past: but
always as a happy accident, as an exception, never as deliberately
_willed_. Very often it has been precisely the most feared; hitherto it
has been almost _the_ terror of terrors;--and out of that terror the
contrary type has been willed, cultivated and _attained_: the domestic
animal, the herd animal, the sick brute-man--the Christian....


4.

Mankind surely does _not_ represent an evolution toward a better or
stronger or higher level, as progress is now understood. This "progress"
is merely a modern idea, which is to say, a false idea. The European of
today, in his essential worth, falls far below the European of the
Renaissance; the process of evolution does _not_ necessarily mean
elevation, enhancement, strengthening.

True enough, it succeeds in isolated and individual cases in various
parts of the earth and under the most widely different cultures, and in
these cases a _higher_ type certainly manifests itself; something which,
compared to mankind in the mass, appears as a sort of superman. Such
happy strokes of high success have always been possible, and will remain
possible, perhaps, for all time to come. Even whole races, tribes and
nations may occasionally represent such lucky accidents.


5.

We should not deck out and embellish Christianity: it has waged a war to
the death against this _higher_ type of man, it has put all the deepest
instincts of this type under its ban, it has developed its concept of
evil, of the Evil One himself, out of these instincts--the strong man as
the typical reprobate, the "outcast among men." Christianity has taken
the part of all the weak, the low, the botched; it has made an ideal out
of _antagonism_ to all the self-preservative instincts of sound life; it
has corrupted even the faculties of those natures that are
intellectually most vigorous, by representing the highest intellectual
values as sinful, as misleading, as full of temptation. The most
lamentable example: the corruption of Pascal, who believed that his
intellect had been destroyed by original sin, whereas it was actually
destroyed by Christianity!--


6.

It is a painful and tragic spectacle that rises before me: I have drawn
back the curtain from the _rottenness_ of man. This word, in my mouth,
is at least free from one suspicion: that it involves a moral accusation
against humanity. It is used--and I wish to emphasize the fact
again--without any moral significance: and this is so far true that the
rottenness I speak of is most apparent to me precisely in those quarters
where there has been most aspiration, hitherto, toward "virtue" and
"godliness." As you probably surmise, I understand rottenness in the
sense of _décadence_: my argument is that all the values on which
mankind now fixes its highest aspirations are _décadence_-values.

I call an animal, a species, an individual corrupt, when it loses its
instincts, when it chooses, when it _prefers_, what is injurious to it.
A history of the "higher feelings," the "ideals of humanity"--and it is
possible that I'll have to write it--would almost explain why man is so
degenerate. Life itself appears to me as an instinct for growth, for
survival, for the accumulation of forces, for _power_: whenever the will
to power fails there is disaster. My contention is that all the highest
values of humanity have been emptied of this will--that the values of
_décadence_, of _nihilism_, now prevail under the holiest names.


7.

Christianity is called the religion of _pity_.--Pity stands in
opposition to all the tonic passions that augment the energy of the
feeling of aliveness: it is a depressant. A man loses power when he
pities. Through pity that drain upon strength which suffering works is
multiplied a thousandfold. Suffering is made contagious by pity; under
certain circumstances it may lead to a total sacrifice of life and
living energy--a loss out of all proportion to the magnitude of the
cause (--the case of the death of the Nazarene). This is the first view
of it; there is, however, a still more important one. If one measures
the effects of pity by the gravity of the reactions it sets up, its
character as a menace to life appears in a much clearer light. Pity
thwarts the whole law of evolution, which is the law of natural
selection. It preserves whatever is ripe for destruction; it fights on
the side of those disinherited and condemned by life; by maintaining
life in so many of the botched of all kinds, it gives life itself a
gloomy and dubious aspect. Mankind has ventured to call pity a virtue
(--in every _superior_ moral system it appears as a weakness--); going
still further, it has been called _the_ virtue, the source and
foundation of all other virtues--but let us always bear in mind that
this was from the standpoint of a philosophy that was nihilistic, and
upon whose shield _the denial of life_ was inscribed. Schopenhauer was
right in this: that by means of pity life is denied, and made _worthy of
denial_--pity is the technic of nihilism. Let me repeat: this depressing
and contagious instinct stands against all those instincts which work
for the preservation and enhancement of life: in the rôle of _protector_
of the miserable, it is a prime agent in the promotion of
_décadence_--pity persuades to extinction.... Of course, one doesn't say
"extinction": one says "the other world," or "God," or "the _true_
life," or Nirvana, salvation, blessedness.... This innocent rhetoric,
from the realm of religious-ethical balderdash, appears _a good deal
less innocent_ when one reflects upon the tendency that it conceals
beneath sublime words: the tendency to _destroy life_. Schopenhauer was
hostile to life: that is why pity appeared to him as a virtue....
Aristotle, as every one knows, saw in pity a sickly and dangerous state
of mind, the remedy for which was an occasional purgative: he regarded
tragedy as that purgative. The instinct of life should prompt us to seek
some means of puncturing any such pathological and dangerous
accumulation of pity as that appearing in Schopenhauer's case (and also,
alack, in that of our whole literary _décadence_, from St. Petersburg to
Paris, from Tolstoi to Wagner), that it may burst and be discharged....
Nothing is more unhealthy, amid all our unhealthy modernism, than
Christian pity. To be the doctors _here_, to be unmerciful _here_, to
wield the knife _here_--all this is _our_ business, all this is _our_
sort of humanity, by this sign we are philosophers, we Hyperboreans!--


8.

It is necessary to say just _whom_ we regard as our antagonists:
theologians and all who have any theological blood in their veins--this
is our whole philosophy.... One must have faced that menace at close
hand, better still, one must have had experience of it directly and
almost succumbed to it, to realize that it is not to be taken lightly
(--the alleged free-thinking of our naturalists and physiologists seems
to me to be a joke--they have no passion about such things; they have
not suffered--). This poisoning goes a great deal further than most
people think: I find the arrogant habit of the theologian among all who
regard themselves as "idealists"--among all who, by virtue of a higher
point of departure, claim a right to rise above reality, and to look
upon it with suspicion.... The idealist, like the ecclesiastic, carries
all sorts of lofty concepts in his hand (--and not only in his hand!);
he launches them with benevolent contempt against "understanding," "the
senses," "honor," "good living," "science"; he sees such things as
_beneath_ him, as pernicious and seductive forces, on which "the soul"
soars as a pure thing-in-itself--as if humility, chastity, poverty, in a
word, _holiness_, had not already done much more damage to life than all
imaginable horrors and vices.... The pure soul is a pure lie.... So long
as the priest, that _professional_ denier, calumniator and poisoner of
life, is accepted as a _higher_ variety of man, there can be no answer
to the question, What _is_ truth? Truth has already been stood on its
head when the obvious attorney of mere emptiness is mistaken for its
representative....


9.

Upon this theological instinct I make war: I find the tracks of it
everywhere. Whoever has theological blood in his veins is shifty and
dishonourable in all things. The pathetic thing that grows out of this
condition is called _faith_: in other words, closing one's eyes upon
one's self once for all, to avoid suffering the sight of incurable
falsehood. People erect a concept of morality, of virtue, of holiness
upon this false view of all things; they ground good conscience upon
faulty vision; they argue that no _other_ sort of vision has value any
more, once they have made theirs sacrosanct with the names of "God,"
"salvation" and "eternity." I unearth this theological instinct in all
directions: it is the most widespread and the most _subterranean_ form
of falsehood to be found on earth. Whatever a theologian regards as true
_must_ be false: there you have almost a criterion of truth. His
profound instinct of self-preservation stands against truth ever coming
into honour in any way, or even getting stated. Wherever the influence
of theologians is felt there is a transvaluation of values, and the
concepts "true" and "false" are forced to change places: whatever is
most damaging to life is there called "true," and whatever exalts it,
intensifies it, approves it, justifies it and makes it triumphant is
there called "false."... When theologians, working through the
"consciences" of princes (or of peoples--), stretch out their hands for
_power_, there is never any doubt as to the fundamental issue: the will
to make an end, the _nihilistic_ will exerts that power....


10.

Among Germans I am immediately understood when I say that theological
blood is the ruin of philosophy. The Protestant pastor is the
grandfather of German philosophy; Protestantism itself is its _peccatum
originale_. Definition of Protestantism: hemiplegic paralysis of
Christianity--_and_ of reason.... One need only utter the words
"Tübingen School" to get an understanding of what German philosophy is
at bottom--a very artful form of theology.... The Suabians are the best
liars in Germany; they lie innocently.... Why all the rejoicing over
the appearance of Kant that went through the learned world of Germany,
three-fourths of which is made up of the sons of preachers and
teachers--why the German conviction still echoing, that with Kant came a
change for the _better_? The theological instinct of German scholars
made them see clearly just _what_ had become possible again.... A
backstairs leading to the old ideal stood open; the concept of the "true
world," the concept of morality as the _essence_ of the world (--the two
most vicious errors that ever existed!), were once more, thanks to a
subtle and wily scepticism, if not actually demonstrable, then _at
least_ no longer _refutable_.... _Reason_, the _prerogative_ of reason,
does not go so far.... Out of reality there had been made "appearance";
an absolutely false world, that of being, had been turned into
reality.... The success of Kant is merely a theological success; he was,
like Luther and Leibnitz, but one more impediment to German integrity,
already far from steady.--

A word now against Kant as a moralist. A virtue must be _our_ invention;
it must spring out of _our_ personal need and defence. In every other
case it is a source of danger. That which does not belong to our life
_menaces_ it; a virtue which has its roots in mere respect for the
concept of "virtue," as Kant would have it, is pernicious. "Virtue,"
"duty," "good for its own sake," goodness grounded upon impersonality or
a notion of universal validity--these are all chimeras, and in them one
finds only an expression of the decay, the last collapse of life, the
Chinese spirit of Königsberg. Quite the contrary is demanded by the most
profound laws of self-preservation and of growth: to wit, that every man
find his _own_ virtue, his _own_ categorical imperative. A nation goes
to pieces when it confounds _its_ duty with the general concept of duty.
Nothing works a more complete and penetrating disaster than every
"impersonal" duty, every sacrifice before the Moloch of abstraction.--To
think that no one has thought of Kant's categorical imperative as
_dangerous to life_!... The theological instinct alone took it under
protection!--An action prompted by the life-instinct proves that it is a
_right_ action by the amount of pleasure that goes with it: and yet that
Nihilist, with his bowels of Christian dogmatism, regarded pleasure as
an _objection_.... What destroys a man more quickly than to work, think
and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire,
without pleasure--as a mere automaton of duty? That is the recipe for
_décadence_, and no less for idiocy.... Kant became an idiot.--And such
a man was the contemporary of Goethe! This calamitous spinner of cobwebs
passed for _the_ German philosopher--still passes today!... I forbid
myself to say what I think of the Germans.... Didn't Kant see in the
French Revolution the transformation of the state from the inorganic
form to the _organic_? Didn't he ask himself if there was a single event
that could be explained save on the assumption of a moral faculty in
man, so that on the basis of it, "the tendency of mankind toward the
good" could be _explained_, once and for all time? Kant's answer: "That
is revolution." Instinct at fault in everything and anything, instinct
as a revolt against nature, German _décadence_ as a philosophy--_that is
Kant_!--


12.

I put aside a few sceptics, the types of decency in the history of
philosophy: the rest haven't the slightest conception of intellectual
integrity. They behave like women, all these great enthusiasts and
prodigies--they regard "beautiful feelings" as arguments, the "heaving
breast" as the bellows of divine inspiration, conviction as the
_criterion_ of truth. In the end, with "German" innocence, Kant tried to
give a scientific flavour to this form of corruption, this dearth of
intellectual conscience, by calling it "practical reason." He
deliberately invented a variety of reasons for use on occasions when it
was desirable not to trouble with reason--that is, when morality, when
the sublime command "thou shalt," was heard. When one recalls the fact
that, among all peoples, the philosopher is no more than a development
from the old type of priest, this inheritance from the priest, this
_fraud upon self_, ceases to be remarkable. When a man feels that he has
a divine mission, say to lift up, to save or to liberate mankind--when a
man feels the divine spark in his heart and believes that he is the
mouthpiece of supernatural imperatives--when such a mission inflames
him, it is only natural that he should stand beyond all merely
reasonable standards of judgment. He feels that he is _himself_
sanctified by this mission, that he is himself a type of a higher
order!... What has a priest to do with philosophy! He stands far above
it!--And hitherto the priest has _ruled_!--He has determined the meaning
of "true" and "not true"!...


13.

Let us not underestimate this fact: that _we
ourselves_, we free spirits, are already a "transvaluation of all
values," a _visualized_ declaration of war and victory against all the
old concepts of "true" and "not true." The most valuable intuitions are
the last to be attained; the most valuable of all are those which
determine _methods_. All the methods, all the principles of the
scientific spirit of today, were the targets for thousands of years of
the most profound contempt; if a man inclined to them he was excluded
from the society of "decent" people--he passed as "an enemy of God," as
a scoffer at the truth, as one "possessed." As a man of science, he
belonged to the Chandala[2].... We have had the whole pathetic stupidity
of mankind against us--their every notion of what the truth _ought_ to
be, of what the service of the truth _ought_ to be--their every "thou
shalt" was launched against us.... Our objectives, our methods, our
quiet, cautious, distrustful manner--all appeared to them as absolutely
discreditable and contemptible.--Looking back, one may almost ask one's
self with reason if it was not actually an _aesthetic_ sense that kept
men blind so long: what they demanded of the truth was picturesque
effectiveness, and of the learned a strong appeal to their senses. It
was our _modesty_ that stood out longest against their taste.... How
well they guessed that, these turkey-cocks of God!

[2] The lowest of the Hindu castes.


14.

We have unlearned something. We have become more modest in every way. We
no longer derive man from the "spirit," from the "godhead"; we have
dropped him back among the beasts. We regard him as the strongest of the
beasts because he is the craftiest; one of the results thereof is his
intellectuality. On the other hand, we guard ourselves against a conceit
which would assert itself even here: that man is the great second
thought in the process of organic evolution. He is, in truth, anything
but the crown of creation: beside him stand many other animals, all at
similar stages of development.... And even when we say that we say a bit
too much, for man, relatively speaking, is the most botched of all the
animals and the sickliest, and he has wandered the most dangerously from
his instincts--though for all that, to be sure, he remains the most
_interesting_!--As regards the lower animals, it was Descartes who first
had the really admirable daring to describe them as _machina_; the whole
of our physiology is directed toward proving the truth of this doctrine.
Moreover, it is illogical to set man apart, as Descartes did: what we
know of man today is limited precisely by the extent to which we have
regarded him, too, as a machine. Formerly we accorded to man, as his
inheritance from some higher order of beings, what was called "free
will"; now we have taken even this will from him, for the term no longer
describes anything that we can understand. The old word "will" now
connotes only a sort of result, an individual reaction, that follows
inevitably upon a series of partly discordant and partly harmonious
stimuli--the will no longer "acts," or "moves."... Formerly it was
thought that man's consciousness, his "spirit," offered evidence of his
high origin, his divinity. That he might be _perfected_, he was advised,
tortoise-like, to draw his senses in, to have no traffic with earthly
things, to shuffle off his mortal coil--then only the important part of
him, the "pure spirit," would remain. Here again we have thought out the
thing better: to us consciousness, or "the spirit," appears as a symptom
of a relative imperfection of the organism, as an experiment, a groping,
a misunderstanding, as an affliction which uses up nervous force
unnecessarily--we deny that anything can be done perfectly so long as it
is done consciously. The "pure spirit" is a piece of pure stupidity:
take away the nervous system and the senses, the so-called "mortal
shell," and _the rest is miscalculation_--that is all!...


15.

Under Christianity neither morality nor religion has any point of
contact with actuality. It offers purely imaginary _causes_ ("God,"
"soul," "ego," "spirit," "free will"--or even "unfree"), and purely
imaginary _effects_ ("sin," "salvation," "grace," "punishment,"
"forgiveness of sins"). Intercourse between imaginary _beings_ ("God,"
"spirits," "souls"); an imaginary _natural history_ (anthropocentric; a
total denial of the concept of natural causes); an imaginary
_psychology_ (misunderstandings of self, misinterpretations of agreeable
or disagreeable general feelings--for example, of the states of the
_nervus sympathicus_ with the help of the sign-language of
religio-ethical balderdash--, "repentance," "pangs of conscience,"
"temptation by the devil," "the presence of God"); an imaginary
_teleology_ (the "kingdom of God," "the last judgment," "eternal
life").--This purely _fictitious world_, greatly to its disadvantage, is
to be differentiated from the world of dreams; the latter at least
reflects reality, whereas the former falsifies it, cheapens it and
denies it. Once the concept of "nature" had been opposed to the concept
of "God," the word "natural" necessarily took on the meaning of
"abominable"--the whole of that fictitious world has its sources in
hatred of the natural (--the real!--), and is no more than evidence of a
profound uneasiness in the presence of reality.... _This explains
everything._ Who alone has any reason for living his way out of reality?
The man who suffers under it. But to suffer from reality one must be a
_botched_ reality.... The preponderance of pains over pleasures is the
cause of this fictitious morality and religion: but such a preponderance
also supplies the formula for _décadence_....


16.

A criticism of the _Christian concept of God_ leads inevitably to the
same conclusion.--A nation that still believes in itself holds fast to
its own god. In him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to
survive, to its virtues--it projects its joy in itself, its feeling of
power, into a being to whom one may offer thanks. He who is rich will
give of his riches; a proud people need a god to whom they can make
_sacrifices_.... Religion, within these limits, is a form of gratitude.
A man is grateful for his own existence: to that end he needs a
god.--Such a god must be able to work both benefits and injuries; he
must be able to play either friend or foe--he is wondered at for the
good he does as well as for the evil he does. But the castration,
against all nature, of such a god, making him a god of goodness alone,
would be contrary to human inclination. Mankind has just as much need
for an evil god as for a good god; it doesn't have to thank mere
tolerance and humanitarianism for its own existence.... What would be
the value of a god who knew nothing of anger, revenge, envy, scorn,
cunning, violence? who had perhaps never experienced the rapturous
_ardeurs_ of victory and of destruction? No one would understand such a
god: why should any one want him?--True enough, when a nation is on the
downward path, when it feels its belief in its own future, its hope of
freedom slipping from it, when it begins to see submission as a first
necessity and the virtues of submission as measures of self-preservation,
then it _must_ overhaul its god. He then becomes a hypocrite, timorous
and demure; he counsels "peace of soul," hate-no-more, leniency, "love"
of friend and foe. He moralizes endlessly; he creeps into every private
virtue; he becomes the god of every man; he becomes a private citizen, a
cosmopolitan.... Formerly he represented a people, the strength of a
people, everything aggressive and thirsty for power in the soul of a
people; now he is simply _the good god_.... The truth is that there is
no other alternative for gods: _either_ they are the will to power--in
which case they are national gods--_or_ incapacity for power--in which
case they have to be good....


17.

Wherever the will to power begins to decline, in whatever form, there is
always an accompanying decline physiologically, a _décadence_. The
divinity of this _décadence_, shorn of its masculine virtues and
passions, is converted perforce into a god of the physiologically
degraded, of the weak. Of course, they do not _call_ themselves the
weak; they call themselves "the good."... No hint is needed to indicate
the moments in history at which the dualistic fiction of a good and an
evil god first became possible. The same instinct which prompts the
inferior to reduce their own god to "goodness-in-itself" also prompts
them to eliminate all good qualities from the god of their superiors;
they make revenge on their masters by making a _devil_ of the latter's
god.--The _good_ god, and the devil like him--both are abortions of
_décadence_.--How can we be so tolerant of the naïveté of Christian
theologians as to join in their doctrine that the evolution of the
concept of god from "the god of Israel," the god of a people, to the
Christian god, the essence of all goodness, is to be described as
_progress_?--But even Renan does this. As if Renan had a right to be
naïve! The contrary actually stares one in the face. When everything
necessary to _ascending_ life; when all that is strong, courageous,
masterful and proud has been eliminated from the concept of a god; when
he has sunk step by step to the level of a staff for the weary, a
sheet-anchor for the drowning; when he becomes the poor man's god, the
sinner's god, the invalid's god _par excellence_, and the attribute of
"saviour" or "redeemer" remains as the one essential attribute of
divinity--just _what_ is the significance of such a metamorphosis?
what does such a _reduction_ of the godhead imply?--To be
sure, the "kingdom of God" has thus grown larger. Formerly he had only
his own people, his "chosen" people. But since then he has gone
wandering, like his people themselves, into foreign parts; he has given
up settling down quietly anywhere; finally he has come to feel at home
everywhere, and is the great cosmopolitan--until now he has the "great
majority" on his side, and half the earth. But this god of the "great
majority," this democrat among gods, has not become a proud heathen god:
on the contrary, he remains a Jew, he remains a god in a corner, a god
of all the dark nooks and crevices, of all the noisesome quarters of the
world!... His earthly kingdom, now as always, is a kingdom of the
underworld, a _souterrain_ kingdom, a ghetto kingdom.... And he himself
is so pale, so weak, so _décadent_.... Even the palest of the pale are
able to master him--messieurs the metaphysicians, those albinos of the
intellect. They spun their webs around him for so long that finally he
was hypnotized, and began to spin himself, and became another
metaphysician. Thereafter he resumed once more his old business of
spinning the world out of his inmost being _sub specie Spinozae_;
thereafter he became ever thinner and paler--became the "ideal," became
"pure spirit," became "the absolute," became "the thing-in-itself."...
_The collapse of a god_: he became a "thing-in-itself."


18.

The Christian concept of a god--the god as the patron of the sick, the
god as a spinner of cobwebs, the god as a spirit--is one of the most
corrupt concepts that has ever been set up in the world: it probably
touches low-water mark in the ebbing evolution of the god-type. God
degenerated into the _contradiction of life_. Instead of being its
transfiguration and eternal Yea! In him war is declared on life, on
nature, on the will to live! God becomes the formula for every slander
upon the "here and now," and for every lie about the "beyond"! In him
nothingness is deified, and the will to nothingness is made holy!...


19.

The fact that the strong races of northern Europe did not repudiate this
Christian god does little credit to their gift for religion--and not
much more to their taste. They ought to have been able to make an end of
such a moribund and worn-out product of the _décadence_. A curse lies
upon them because they were not equal to it; they made illness,
decrepitude and contradiction a part of their instincts--and since then
they have not managed to _create_ any more gods. Two thousand years have
come and gone--and not a single new god! Instead, there still exists,
and as if by some intrinsic right,--as if he were the _ultimatum_ and
_maximum_ of the power to create gods, of the _creator spiritus_ in
mankind--this pitiful god of Christian monotono-theism! This hybrid
image of decay, conjured up out of emptiness, contradiction and vain
imagining, in which all the instincts of _décadence_, all the cowardices
and wearinesses of the soul find their sanction!--


20.

In my condemnation of Christianity I surely hope I do no injustice to a
related religion with an even larger number of believers: I allude to
_Buddhism_. Both are to be reckoned among the nihilistic religions--they
are both _décadence_ religions--but they are separated from each other
in a very remarkable way. For the fact that he is able to _compare_ them
at all the critic of Christianity is indebted to the scholars of
India.--Buddhism is a hundred times as realistic as Christianity--it is
part of its living heritage that it is able to face problems objectively
and coolly; it is the product of long centuries of philosophical
speculation. The concept, "god," was already disposed of before it
appeared. Buddhism is the only genuinely _positive_ religion to be
encountered in history, and this applies even to its epistemology (which
is a strict phenomenalism). It does not speak of a "struggle with sin,"
but, yielding to reality, of the "struggle with suffering." Sharply
differentiating itself from Christianity, it puts the self-deception
that lies in moral concepts behind it; it is, in my phrase, _beyond_
good and evil.--The two physiological facts upon which it grounds itself
and upon which it bestows its chief attention are: first, an excessive
sensitiveness to sensation, which manifests itself as a refined
susceptibility to pain, and _secondly_, an extraordinary spirituality, a
too protracted concern with concepts and logical procedures, under the
influence of which the instinct of personality has yielded to a notion
of the "impersonal." (--Both of these states will be familiar to a few
of my readers, the objectivists, by experience, as they are to me).
These physiological states produced a _depression_, and Buddha tried to
combat it by hygienic measures. Against it he prescribed a life in the
open, a life of travel; moderation in eating and a careful selection of
foods; caution in the use of intoxicants; the same caution in arousing
any of the passions that foster a bilious habit and heat the blood;
finally, no _worry_, either on one's own account or on account of
others. He encourages ideas that make for either quiet contentment or
good cheer--he finds means to combat ideas of other sorts. He
understands good, the state of goodness, as something which promotes
health. _Prayer_ is not included, and neither is _asceticism_. There is
no categorical imperative nor any disciplines, even within the walls of
a monastery (--it is always possible to leave--). These things would
have been simply means of increasing the excessive sensitiveness above
mentioned. For the same reason he does not advocate any conflict with
unbelievers; his teaching is antagonistic to nothing so much as to
revenge, aversion, _ressentiment_ (--"enmity never brings an end to
enmity": the moving refrain of all Buddhism....) And in all this he was
right, for it is precisely these passions which, in view of his main
regiminal purpose, are _unhealthful_. The mental fatigue that he
observes, already plainly displayed in too much "objectivity" (that is,
in the individual's loss of interest in himself, in loss of balance and
of "egoism"), he combats by strong efforts to lead even the spiritual
interests back to the _ego_. In Buddha's teaching egoism is a duty. The
"one thing needful," the question "how can you be delivered from
suffering," regulates and determines the whole spiritual diet.
(--Perhaps one will here recall that Athenian who also declared war upon
pure "scientificality," to wit, Socrates, who also elevated egoism to
the estate of a morality).


21.

The things necessary to Buddhism are a very mild climate, customs of
great gentleness and liberality, and _no_ militarism; moreover, it must
get its start among the higher and better educated classes.
Cheerfulness, quiet and the absence of desire are the chief desiderata,
and they are _attained_. Buddhism is not a religion in which perfection
is merely an object of aspiration: perfection is actually normal.--

Under Christianity the instincts of the subjugated and the oppressed
come to the fore: it is only those who are at the bottom who seek their
salvation in it. Here the prevailing pastime, the favourite remedy for
boredom is the discussion of sin, self-criticism, the inquisition of
conscience; here the emotion produced by _power_ (called "God") is
pumped up (by prayer); here the highest good is regarded as
unattainable, as a gift, as "grace." Here, too, open dealing is lacking;
concealment and the darkened room are Christian. Here body is despised
and hygiene is denounced as sensual; the church even ranges itself
against cleanliness (--the first Christian order after the banishment of
the Moors closed the public baths, of which there were 270 in Cordova
alone). Christian, too, is a certain cruelty toward one's self and
toward others; hatred of unbelievers; the will to persecute. Sombre and
disquieting ideas are in the foreground; the most esteemed states of
mind, bearing the most respectable names, are epileptoid; the diet is so
regulated as to engender morbid symptoms and over-stimulate the nerves.
Christian, again, is all deadly enmity to the rulers of the earth, to
the "aristocratic"--along with a sort of secret rivalry with them (--one
resigns one's "body" to them; one wants _only_ one's "soul"...). And
Christian is all hatred of the intellect, of pride, of courage, of
freedom, of intellectual _libertinage_; Christian is all hatred of the
senses, of joy in the senses, of joy in general....


22.

When Christianity departed from its native soil, that of the lowest
orders, the _underworld_ of the ancient world, and began seeking power
among barbarian peoples, it no longer had to deal with _exhausted_ men,
but with men still inwardly savage and capable of self-torture--in
brief, strong men, but bungled men. Here, unlike in the case of the
Buddhists, the cause of discontent with self, suffering through self, is
_not_ merely a general sensitiveness and susceptibility to pain, but, on
the contrary, an inordinate thirst for inflicting pain on others, a
tendency to obtain subjective satisfaction in hostile deeds and ideas.
Christianity had to embrace _barbaric_ concepts and valuations in order
to obtain mastery over barbarians: of such sort, for example, are the
sacrifices of the first-born, the drinking of blood as a sacrament, the
disdain of the intellect and of culture; torture in all its forms,
whether bodily or not; the whole pomp of the cult. Buddhism is a
religion for peoples in a further state of development, for races that
have become kind, gentle and over-spiritualized (--Europe is not yet
ripe for it--): it is a summons that takes them back to peace and
cheerfulness, to a careful rationing of the spirit, to a certain
hardening of the body. Christianity aims at mastering _beasts of prey_;
its modus operandi is to make them _ill_--to make feeble is the
Christian recipe for taming, for "_civilizing_." Buddhism is a religion
for the closing, over-wearied stages of civilization. Christianity
appears before civilization has so much as begun--under certain
circumstances it lays the very foundations thereof.


23.

Buddhism, I repeat, is a hundred times more austere, more honest, more
objective. It no longer has to _justify_ its pains, its susceptibility
to suffering, by interpreting these things in terms of sin--it simply
says, as it simply thinks, "I suffer." To the barbarian, however,
suffering in itself is scarcely understandable: what he needs, first of
all, is an explanation as to _why_ he suffers. (His mere instinct
prompts him to deny his suffering altogether, or to endure it in
silence.) Here the word "devil" was a blessing: man had to have an
omnipotent and terrible enemy--there was no need to be ashamed of
suffering at the hands of such an enemy.--

At the bottom of Christianity there are several subtleties that belong
to the Orient. In the first place, it knows that it is of very little
consequence whether a thing be true or not, so long as it is _believed_
to be true. Truth and _faith_: here we have two wholly distinct worlds
of ideas, almost two diametrically _opposite_ worlds--the road to the
one and the road to the other lie miles apart. To understand that fact
thoroughly--this is almost enough, in the Orient, to _make_ one a sage.
The Brahmins knew it, Plato knew it, every student of the esoteric knows
it. When, for example, a man gets any _pleasure_ out of the notion that
he has been saved from sin, it is _not_ necessary for him to be actually
sinful, but merely to _feel_ sinful. But when _faith_ is thus exalted
above everything else, it necessarily follows that reason, knowledge and
patient inquiry have to be discredited: the road to the truth becomes a
forbidden road.--Hope, in its stronger forms, is a great deal more
powerful _stimulans_ to life than any sort of realized joy can ever be.
Man must be sustained in suffering by a hope so high that no conflict
with actuality can dash it--so high, indeed, that no fulfilment can
_satisfy_ it: a hope reaching out beyond this world. (Precisely because
of this power that hope has of making the suffering hold out, the Greeks
regarded it as the evil of evils, as the most _malign_ of evils; it
remained behind at the source of all evil.)[3]--In order that _love_ may
be possible, God must become a person; in order that the lower instincts
may take a hand in the matter God must be young. To satisfy the ardor of
the woman a beautiful saint must appear on the scene, and to satisfy
that of the men there must be a virgin. These things are necessary if
Christianity is to assume lordship over a soil on which some
aphrodisiacal or Adonis cult has already established a notion as to what
a cult ought to be. To insist upon _chastity_ greatly strengthens the
vehemence and subjectivity of the religious instinct--it makes the cult
warmer, more enthusiastic, more soulful.--Love is the state in which man
sees things most decidedly as they are _not_. The force of illusion
reaches its highest here, and so does the capacity for sweetening, for
_transfiguring_. When a man is in love he endures more than at any other
time; he submits to anything. The problem was to devise a religion which
would allow one to love: by this means the worst that life has to offer
is overcome--it is scarcely even noticed.--So much for the three
Christian virtues: faith, hope and charity: I call them the three
Christian _ingenuities_.--Buddhism is in too late a stage of
development, too full of positivism, to be shrewd in any such way.--

[3] That is, in Pandora's box.


24.

Here I barely touch upon the problem of the _origin_ of Christianity.
The _first_ thing necessary to its solution is this: that Christianity
is to be understood only by examining the soil from which it sprung--it
is _not_ a reaction against Jewish instincts; it is their inevitable
product; it is simply one more step in the awe-inspiring logic of the
Jews. In the words of the Saviour, "salvation is of the Jews."[4]--The
_second_ thing to remember is this: that the psychological type of the
Galilean is still to be recognized, but it was only in its most
degenerate form (which is at once maimed and overladen with foreign
features) that it could serve in the manner in which it has been used:
as a type of the _Saviour_ of mankind.--

[4] John iv, 22.

The Jews are the most remarkable people in the history of the world, for
when they were confronted with the question, to be or not to be, they
chose, with perfectly unearthly deliberation, to be _at any price_: this
price involved a radical _falsification_ of all nature, of all
naturalness, of all reality, of the whole inner world, as well as of
the outer. They put themselves _against_ all those conditions under
which, hitherto, a people had been able to live, or had even been
_permitted_ to live; out of themselves they evolved an idea which stood
in direct opposition to _natural_ conditions--one by one they distorted
religion, civilization, morality, history and psychology until each
became a _contradiction_ of its _natural significance_. We meet with the
same phenomenon later on, in an incalculably exaggerated form, but only
as a copy: the Christian church, put beside the "people of God," shows a
complete lack of any claim to originality. Precisely for this reason the
Jews are the most _fateful_ people in the history of the world: their
influence has so falsified the reasoning of mankind in this matter that
today the Christian can cherish anti-Semitism without realizing that it
is no more than the _final consequence of Judaism_.

In my "Genealogy of Morals" I give the first psychological explanation
of the concepts underlying those two antithetical things, a _noble_
morality and a _ressentiment_ morality, the second of which is a mere
product of the denial of the former. The Judaeo-Christian moral system
belongs to the second division, and in every detail. In order to be able
to say Nay to everything representing an _ascending_ evolution of
life--that is, to well-being, to power, to beauty, to self-approval--the
instincts of _ressentiment_, here become downright genius, had to invent
an _other_ world in which the _acceptance of life_ appeared as the most
evil and abominable thing imaginable. Psychologically, the Jews are a
people gifted with the very strongest vitality, so much so that when
they found themselves facing impossible conditions of life they chose
voluntarily, and with a profound talent for self-preservation, the side
of all those instincts which make for _décadence_--_not_ as if mastered
by them, but as if detecting in them a power by which "the world" could
be _defied_. The Jews are the very opposite of _décadents_: they have
simply been forced into _appearing_ in that guise, and with a degree of
skill approaching the _non plus ultra_ of histrionic genius they have
managed to put themselves at the head of all _décadent_ movements (--for
example, the Christianity of Paul--), and so make of them something
stronger than any party frankly saying _Yes_ to life. To the sort of
men who reach out for power under Judaism and Christianity,--that is to
say, to the _priestly_ class--_décadence_ is no more than a means to an
end. Men of this sort have a vital interest in making mankind sick, and
in confusing the values of "good" and "bad," "true" and "false" in a
manner that is not only dangerous to life, but also slanders it.

The history of Israel is invaluable as a typical history of an attempt
to _denaturize_ all natural values: I point to five facts which bear
this out. Originally, and above all in the time of the monarchy, Israel
maintained the _right_ attitude of things, which is to say, the natural
attitude. Its Jahveh was an expression of its consciousness of power,
its joy in itself, its hopes for itself: to him the Jews looked for
victory and salvation and through him they expected nature to give them
whatever was necessary to their existence--above all, rain. Jahveh is
the god of Israel, and _consequently_ the god of justice: this is the
logic of every race that has power in its hands and a good conscience in
the use of it. In the religious ceremonial of the Jews both aspects of
this self-approval stand revealed. The nation is grateful for the high
destiny that has enabled it to obtain dominion; it is grateful for the
benign procession of the seasons, and for the good fortune attending its
herds and its crops.--This view of things remained an ideal for a long
while, even after it had been robbed of validity by tragic blows:
anarchy within and the Assyrian without. But the people still retained,
as a projection of their highest yearnings, that vision of a king who
was at once a gallant warrior and an upright judge--a vision best
visualized in the typical prophet (_i. e._, critic and satirist of the
moment), Isaiah.--But every hope remained unfulfilled. The old god no
longer _could_ do what he used to do. He ought to have been abandoned.
But what actually happened? Simply this: the conception of him was
_changed_--the conception of him was _denaturized_; this was the price
that had to be paid for keeping him.--Jahveh, the god of "justice"--he
is in accord with Israel _no more_, he no longer vizualizes the national
egoism; he is now a god only conditionally.... The public notion of this
god now becomes merely a weapon in the hands of clerical agitators, who
interpret all happiness as a reward and all unhappiness as a punishment
for obedience or disobedience to him, for "sin": that most fraudulent of
all imaginable interpretations, whereby a "moral order of the world" is
set up, and the fundamental concepts, "cause" and "effect," are stood on
their heads. Once natural causation has been swept out of the world by
doctrines of reward and punishment some sort of _un_-natural causation
becomes necessary: and all other varieties of the denial of nature
follow it. A god who _demands_--in place of a god who helps, who gives
counsel, who is at bottom merely a name for every happy inspiration of
courage and self-reliance.... _Morality_ is no longer a reflection of
the conditions which make for the sound life and development of the
people; it is no longer the primary life-instinct; instead it has become
abstract and in opposition to life--a fundamental perversion of the
fancy, an "evil eye" on all things. _What_ is Jewish, _what_ is
Christian morality? Chance robbed of its innocence; unhappiness polluted
with the idea of "sin"; well-being represented as a danger, as a
"temptation"; a physiological disorder produced by the canker worm of
conscience....


26.

The concept of god falsified; the concept of morality falsified;--but
even here Jewish priest-craft did not stop. The whole history of Israel
ceased to be of any value: out with it!--These priests accomplished that
miracle of falsification of which a great part of the Bible is the
documentary evidence; with a degree of contempt unparalleled, and in the
face of all tradition and all historical reality, they translated the
past of their people into _religious_ terms, which is to say, they
converted it into an idiotic mechanism of salvation, whereby all
offences against Jahveh were punished and all devotion to him was
rewarded. We would regard this act of historical falsification as
something far more shameful if familiarity with the _ecclesiastical_
interpretation of history for thousands of years had not blunted our
inclinations for uprightness _in historicis_. And the philosophers
support the church: the _lie_ about a "moral order of the world" runs
through the whole of philosophy, even the newest. What is the meaning
of a "moral order of the world"? That there is a thing called the will
of God which, once and for all time, determines what man ought to do and
what he ought not to do; that the worth of a people, or of an individual
thereof, is to be measured by the extent to which they or he obey this
will of God; that the destinies of a people or of an individual are
_controlled_ by this will of God, which rewards or punishes according to
the degree of obedience manifested.--In place of all that pitiable lie
_reality_ has this to say: the _priest_, a parasitical variety of man
who can exist only at the cost of every sound view of life, takes the
name of God in vain: he calls that state of human society in which he
himself determines the value of all things "the kingdom of God"; he
calls the means whereby that state of affairs is attained "the will of
God"; with cold-blooded cynicism he estimates all peoples, all ages and
all individuals by the extent of their subservience or opposition to the
power of the priestly order. One observes him at work: under the hand of
the Jewish priesthood the _great_ age of Israel became an age of
decline; the Exile, with its long series of misfortunes, was
transformed into a _punishment_ for that great age--during which priests
had not yet come into existence. Out of the powerful and _wholly free_
heroes of Israel's history they fashioned, according to their changing
needs, either wretched bigots and hypocrites or men entirely "godless."
They reduced every great event to the idiotic formula: "obedient _or_
disobedient to God."--They went a step further: the "will of God" (in
other words some means necessary for preserving the power of the
priests) had to be _determined_--and to this end they had to have a
"revelation." In plain English, a gigantic literary fraud had to be
perpetrated, and "holy scriptures" had to be concocted--and so, with the
utmost hierarchical pomp, and days of penance and much lamentation over
the long days of "sin" now ended, they were duly published. The "will of
God," it appears, had long stood like a rock; the trouble was that
mankind had neglected the "holy scriptures".... But the "will of God"
had already been revealed to Moses.... What happened? Simply this: the
priest had formulated, once and for all time and with the strictest
meticulousness, what tithes were to be paid to him, from the largest to
the smallest (--not forgetting the most appetizing cuts of meat, for
the priest is a great consumer of beefsteaks); in brief, he let it be
known just _what he wanted_, what "the will of God" was.... From this
time forward things were so arranged that the priest became
_indispensable everywhere_; at all the great natural events of life, at
birth, at marriage, in sickness, at death, not to say at the
"_sacrifice_" (that is, at meal-times), the holy parasite put in his
appearance, and proceeded to _denaturize_ it--in his own phrase, to
"sanctify" it.... For this should be noted: that every natural habit,
every natural institution (the state, the administration of justice,
marriage, the care of the sick and of the poor), everything demanded by
the life-instinct, in short, everything that has any value _in itself_,
is reduced to absolute worthlessness and even made the _reverse_ of
valuable by the parasitism of priests (or, if you chose, by the "moral
order of the world"). The fact requires a sanction--a power to _grant
values_ becomes necessary, and the only way it can create such values is
by denying nature.... The priest depreciates and desecrates nature: it
is only at this price that he can exist at all.--Disobedience to God,
which actually means to the priest, to "the law," now gets the name of
"sin"; the means prescribed for "reconciliation with God" are, of
course, precisely the means which bring one most effectively under the
thumb of the priest; he alone can "save".... Psychologically considered,
"sins" are indispensable to every society organized on an ecclesiastical
basis; they are the only reliable weapons of power; the priest _lives_
upon sins; it is necessary to him that there be "sinning".... Prime
axiom: "God forgiveth him that repenteth"--in plain English, _him that
submitteth to the priest_.


27.

Christianity sprang from a soil so corrupt that on it everything
natural, every natural value, every _reality_ was opposed by the deepest
instincts of the ruling class--it grew up as a sort of war to the death
upon reality, and as such it has never been surpassed. The "holy
people," who had adopted priestly values and priestly names for all
things, and who, with a terrible logical consistency, had rejected
everything of the earth as "unholy," "worldly," "sinful"--this people
put its instinct into a final formula that was logical to the point of
self-annihilation: as _Christianity_ it actually denied even the last
form of reality, the "holy people," the "chosen people," _Jewish_
reality itself. The phenomenon is of the first order of importance: the
small insurrectionary movement which took the name of Jesus of Nazareth
is simply the Jewish instinct _redivivus_--in other words, it is the
priestly instinct come to such a pass that it can no longer endure the
priest as a fact; it is the discovery of a state of existence even more
fantastic than any before it, of a vision of life even more _unreal_
than that necessary to an ecclesiastical organization. Christianity
actually _denies_ the church....

I am unable to determine what was the target of the insurrection said to
have been led (whether rightly or _wrongly_) by Jesus, if it was not the
Jewish church--"church" being here used in exactly the same sense that
the word has today. It was an insurrection against the "good and just,"
against the "prophets of Israel," against the whole hierarchy of
society--_not_ against corruption, but against caste, privilege, order,
formalism. It was _unbelief_ in "superior men," a Nay flung at
everything that priests and theologians stood for. But the hierarchy
that was called into question, if only for an instant, by this movement
was the structure of piles which, above everything, was necessary to the
safety of the Jewish people in the midst of the "waters"--it represented
their _last_ possibility of survival; it was the final _residuum_ of
their independent political existence; an attack upon it was an attack
upon the most profound national instinct, the most powerful national
will to live, that has ever appeared on earth. This saintly anarchist,
who aroused the people of the abyss, the outcasts and "sinners," the
Chandala of Judaism, to rise in revolt against the established order of
things--and in language which, if the Gospels are to be credited, would
get him sent to Siberia today--this man was certainly a political
criminal, at least in so far as it was possible to be one in so
_absurdly unpolitical_ a community. This is what brought him to the
cross: the proof thereof is to be found in the inscription that was put
upon the cross. He died for his _own_ sins--there is not the slightest
ground for believing, no matter how often it is asserted, that he died
for the sins of others.--


28.

As to whether he himself was conscious of this contradiction--whether,
in fact, this was the only contradiction he was cognizant of--that is
quite another question. Here, for the first time, I touch upon the
problem of the _psychology of the Saviour_.--I confess, to begin with,
that there are very few books which offer me harder reading than the
Gospels. My difficulties are quite different from those which enabled
the learned curiosity of the German mind to achieve one of its most
unforgettable triumphs. It is a long while since I, like all other young
scholars, enjoyed with all the sapient laboriousness of a fastidious
philologist the work of the incomparable Strauss.[5] At that time I was
twenty years old: now I am too serious for that sort of thing. What do I
care for the contradictions of "tradition"? How can any one call pious
legends "traditions"? The histories of saints present the most dubious
variety of literature in existence; to examine them by the scientific
method, _in the entire absence of corroborative documents_, seems to me
to condemn the whole inquiry from the start--it is simply learned
idling....

(1835-6), a very famous work in its day. Nietzsche here refers to it.

What concerns _me_ is the psychological type of the Saviour. This type
might be depicted in the Gospels, in however mutilated a form and
however much overladen with extraneous characters--that is, in _spite_
of the Gospels; just as the figure of Francis of Assisi shows itself in
his legends in spite of his legends. It is _not_ a question of mere
truthful evidence as to what he did, what he said and how he actually
died; the question is, whether his type is still conceivable, whether it
has been handed down to us.--All the attempts that I know of to read the
_history_ of a "soul" in the Gospels seem to me to reveal only a
lamentable psychological levity. M. Renan, that mountebank _in
psychologicus_, has contributed the two most _unseemly_ notions to this
business of explaining the type of Jesus: the notion of the _genius_ and
that of the _hero_ ("_héros_"). But if there is anything essentially
unevangelical, it is surely the concept of the hero. What the Gospels
make instinctive is precisely the reverse of all heroic struggle, of
all taste for conflict: the very incapacity for resistance is here
converted into something moral: ("resist not evil!"--the most profound
sentence in the Gospels, perhaps the true key to them), to wit, the
blessedness of peace, of gentleness, the _inability_ to be an enemy.
What is the meaning of "glad tidings"?--The true life, the life eternal
has been found--it is not merely promised, it is here, it is in _you_;
it is the life that lies in love free from all retreats and exclusions,
from all keeping of distances. Every one is the child of God--Jesus
claims nothing for himself alone--as the child of God each man is the
equal of every other man.... Imagine making Jesus a _hero_!--And what a
tremendous misunderstanding appears in the word "genius"! Our whole
conception of the "spiritual," the whole conception of our civilization,
could have had no meaning in the world that Jesus lived in. In the
strict sense of the physiologist, a quite different word ought to be
used here.... We all know that there is a morbid sensibility of the
tactile nerves which causes those suffering from it to recoil from every
touch, and from every effort to grasp a solid object. Brought to its
logical conclusion, such a physiological _habitus_ becomes an
instinctive hatred of all reality, a flight into the "intangible," into
the "incomprehensible"; a distaste for all formulae, for all conceptions
of time and space, for everything established--customs, institutions,
the church--; a feeling of being at home in a world in which no sort of
reality survives, a merely "inner" world, a "true" world, an "eternal"
world.... "The Kingdom of God is within _you_"....


30.

_The instinctive hatred of reality_: the consequence of an extreme
susceptibility to pain and irritation--so great that merely to be
"touched" becomes unendurable, for every sensation is too profound.

_The instinctive exclusion of all aversion, all hostility, all bounds
and distances in feeling_: the consequence of an extreme susceptibility
to pain and irritation--so great that it senses all resistance, all
compulsion to resistance, as unbearable _anguish_ (--that is to say, as
_harmful_, as _prohibited_ by the instinct of self-preservation), and
regards blessedness (joy) as possible only when it is no longer
necessary to offer resistance to anybody or anything, however evil or
dangerous--love, as the only, as the _ultimate_ possibility of life....

These are the two _physiological realities_ upon and out of which the
doctrine of salvation has sprung. I call them a sublime
super-development of hedonism upon a thoroughly unsalubrious soil. What
stands most closely related to them, though with a large admixture of
Greek vitality and nerve-force, is epicureanism, the theory of salvation
of paganism. Epicurus was a _typical décadent_: I was the first to
recognize him.--The fear of pain, even of infinitely slight pain--the
end of this _can_ be nothing save a _religion of love_....


31.

I have already given my answer to the problem. The prerequisite to it is
the assumption that the type of the Saviour has reached us only in a
greatly distorted form. This distortion is very probable: there are many
reasons why a type of that sort should not be handed down in a pure
form, complete and free of additions. The milieu in which this strange
figure moved must have left marks upon him, and more must have been
imprinted by the history, the _destiny_, of the early Christian
communities; the latter indeed, must have embellished the type
retrospectively with characters which can be understood only as serving
the purposes of war and of propaganda. That strange and sickly world
into which the Gospels lead us--a world apparently out of a Russian
novel, in which the scum of society, nervous maladies and "childish"
idiocy keep a tryst--must, in any case, have _coarsened_ the type: the
first disciples, in particular, must have been forced to translate an
existence visible only in symbols and incomprehensibilities into their
own crudity, in order to understand it at all--in their sight the type
could take on reality only after it had been recast in a familiar
mould.... The prophet, the messiah, the future judge, the teacher of
morals, the worker of wonders, John the Baptist--all these merely
presented chances to misunderstand it.... Finally, let us not underrate
the _proprium_ of all great, and especially all sectarian veneration: it
tends to erase from the venerated objects all its original traits and
idiosyncrasies, often so painfully strange--_it does not even see
them_. It is greatly to be regretted that no Dostoyevsky lived in the
neighbourhood of this most interesting _décadent_--I mean some one who
would have felt the poignant charm of such a compound of the sublime,
the morbid and the childish. In the last analysis, the type, as a type
of the _décadence_, may actually have been peculiarly complex and
contradictory: such a possibility is not to be lost sight of.
Nevertheless, the probabilities seem to be against it, for in that case
tradition would have been particularly accurate and objective, whereas
we have reasons for assuming the contrary. Meanwhile, there is a
contradiction between the peaceful preacher of the mount, the sea-shore
and the fields, who appears like a new Buddha on a soil very unlike
India's, and the aggressive fanatic, the mortal enemy of theologians and
ecclesiastics, who stands glorified by Renan's malice as "_le grand
maître en ironie_." I myself haven't any doubt that the greater part of
this venom (and no less of _esprit_) got itself into the concept of the
Master only as a result of the excited nature of Christian propaganda:
we all know the unscrupulousness of sectarians when they set out to turn
their leader into an _apologia_ for themselves. When the early
Christians had need of an adroit, contentious, pugnacious and
maliciously subtle theologian to tackle other theologians, they
_created_ a "god" that met that need, just as they put into his mouth
without hesitation certain ideas that were necessary to them but that
were utterly at odds with the Gospels--"the second coming," "the last
judgment," all sorts of expectations and promises, current at the
time.--


32.

I can only repeat that I set myself against all efforts to intrude the
fanatic into the figure of the Saviour: the very word _impérieux_, used
by Renan, is alone enough to _annul_ the type. What the "glad tidings"
tell us is simply that there are no more contradictions; the kingdom of
heaven belongs to _children_; the faith that is voiced here is no more
an embattled faith--it is at hand, it has been from the beginning, it is
a sort of recrudescent childishness of the spirit. The physiologists, at
all events, are familiar with such a delayed and incomplete puberty in
the living organism, the result of degeneration. A faith of this sort is
not furious, it does not denounce, it does not defend itself: it does
not come with "the sword"--it does not realize how it will one day set
man against man. It does not manifest itself either by miracles, or by
rewards and promises, or by "scriptures": it is itself, first and last,
its own miracle, its own reward, its own promise, its own "kingdom of
God." This faith does not formulate itself--it simply _lives_, and so
guards itself against formulae. To be sure, the accident of environment,
of educational background gives prominence to concepts of a certain
sort: in primitive Christianity one finds _only_ concepts of a
Judaeo-Semitic character (--that of eating and drinking at the last
supper belongs to this category--an idea which, like everything else
Jewish, has been badly mauled by the church). But let us be careful not
to see in all this anything more than symbolical language, semantics[6]
an opportunity to speak in parables. It is only on the theory that no
work is to be taken literally that this anti-realist is able to speak at
all. Set down among Hindus he would have made use of the concepts of
Sankhya,[7] and among Chinese he would have employed those of
Lao-tse[8]--and in neither case would it have made any difference to
him.--With a little freedom in the use of words, one might actually call
Jesus a "free spirit"[9]--he cares nothing for what is established: the
word _killeth_,[10] whatever is established _killeth_. The idea of
"life" as an _experience_, as he alone conceives it, stands opposed to
his mind to every sort of word, formula, law, belief and dogma. He
speaks only of inner things: "life" or "truth" or "light" is his word
for the innermost--in his sight everything else, the whole of reality,
all nature, even language, has significance only as sign, as
allegory.--Here it is of paramount importance to be led into no error by
the temptations lying in Christian, or rather _ecclesiastical_
prejudices: such a symbolism _par excellence_ stands outside all
religion, all notions of worship, all history, all natural science, all
worldly experience, all knowledge, all politics, all psychology, all
books, all art--his "wisdom" is precisely a _pure ignorance_[11] of all
such things. He has never heard of _culture_; he doesn't have to make
war on it--he doesn't even deny it.... The same thing may be said of the
_state_, of the whole bourgeoise social order, of labour, of war--he has
no ground for denying "the world," for he knows nothing of the
ecclesiastical concept of "the world".... _Denial_ is precisely the
thing that is impossible to him.--In the same way he lacks argumentative
capacity, and has no belief that an article of faith, a "truth," may be
established by proofs (--_his_ proofs are inner "lights," subjective
sensations of happiness and self-approval, simple "proofs of power"--).
Such a doctrine _cannot_ contradict: it doesn't know that other
doctrines exist, or _can_ exist, and is wholly incapable of imagining
anything opposed to it.... If anything of the sort is ever encountered,
it laments the "blindness" with sincere sympathy--for it alone has
"light"--but it does not offer objections....

In the whole psychology of the "Gospels" the concepts of guilt and
punishment are lacking, and so is that of reward. "Sin," which means
anything that puts a distance between God and man, is abolished--_this
is precisely the "glad tidings."_ Eternal bliss is not merely promised,
nor is it bound up with conditions: it is conceived as the _only_
reality--what remains consists merely of signs useful in speaking of it.

The _results_ of such a point of view project themselves into a new _way
of life_, the special evangelical way of life. It is not a "belief" that
marks off the Christian; he is distinguished by a different mode of
action; he acts _differently_. He offers no resistance, either by word
or in his heart, to those who stand against him. He draws no distinction
between strangers and countrymen, Jews and Gentiles ("neighbour," of
course, means fellow-believer, Jew). He is angry with no one, and he
despises no one. He neither appeals to the courts of justice nor heeds
their mandates ("Swear not at all").[12] He never under any
circumstances divorces his wife, even when he has proofs of her
infidelity.--And under all of this is one principle; all of it arises
from one instinct.--

[12] Matthew v, 34.

The life of the Saviour was simply a carrying out of this way of
life--and so was his death.... He no longer needed any formula or ritual
in his relations with God--not even prayer. He had rejected the whole of
the Jewish doctrine of repentance and atonement; he _knew_ that it was
only by a _way_ of life that one could feel one's self "divine,"
"blessed," "evangelical," a "child of God." _Not_ by "repentance," _not_
by "prayer and forgiveness" is the way to God: _only the Gospel way_
leads to God--it is _itself_ "God!"--What the Gospels _abolished_ was
the Judaism in the concepts of "sin," "forgiveness of sin," "faith,"
"salvation through faith"--the whole _ecclesiastical_ dogma of the Jews
was denied by the "glad tidings."

The deep instinct which prompts the Christian how to _live_ so that he
will feel that he is "in heaven" and is "immortal," despite many reasons
for feeling that he is _not_ "in heaven": this is the only psychological
reality in "salvation."--A new way of life, _not_ a new faith....


34.

If I understand anything at all about this great symbolist, it is this:
that he regarded only _subjective_ realities as realities, as
"truths"--that he saw everything else, everything natural, temporal,
spatial and historical, merely as signs, as materials for parables. The
concept of "the Son of God" does not connote a concrete person in
history, an isolated and definite individual, but an "eternal" fact, a
psychological symbol set free from the concept of time. The same thing
is true, and in the highest sense, of the _God_ of this typical
symbolist, of the "kingdom of God," and of the "sonship of God." Nothing
could be more un-Christian than the _crude ecclesiastical_ notions of
God as a _person_, of a "kingdom of God" that is to come, of a "kingdom
of heaven" beyond, and of a "son of God" as the _second person_ of the
Trinity. All this--if I may be forgiven the phrase--is like thrusting
one's fist into the eye (and what an eye!) of the Gospels: a disrespect
for symbols amounting to _world-historical cynicism_.... But it is
nevertheless obvious enough what is meant by the symbols "Father" and
"Son"--not, of course, to every one--: the word "Son" expresses
_entrance_ into the feeling that there is a general transformation of
all things (beatitude), and "Father" expresses _that feeling
itself_--the sensation of eternity and of perfection.--I am ashamed to
remind you of what the church has made of this symbolism: has it not set
an Amphitryon story[13] at the threshold of the Christian "faith"? And a
dogma of "immaculate conception" for good measure?... _And thereby it
has robbed conception of its immaculateness_--

[13] Amphitryon was the son of Alcaeus, King of Tiryns.
His wife was Alcmene. During his absence she was visited by Zeus, and
bore Heracles.

The "kingdom of heaven" is a state of the heart--not something to come
"beyond the world" or "after death." The whole idea of natural death is
_absent_ from the Gospels: death is not a bridge, not a passing; it is
absent because it belongs to a quite different, a merely apparent world,
useful only as a symbol. The "hour of death" is _not_ a Christian
idea--"hours," time, the physical life and its crises have no existence
for the bearer of "glad tidings."... The "kingdom of God" is not
something that men wait for: it had no yesterday and no day after
tomorrow, it is not going to come at a "millennium"--it is an experience
of the heart, it is everywhere and it is nowhere....


35.

This "bearer of glad tidings" died as he lived and _taught_--_not_ to
"save mankind," but to show mankind how to live. It was a _way of life_
that he bequeathed to man: his demeanour before the judges, before the
officers, before his accusers--his demeanour on the _cross_. He does not
resist; he does not defend his rights; he makes no effort to ward off
the most extreme penalty--more, _he invites it_.... And he prays,
suffers and loves _with_ those, _in_ those, who do him evil.... _Not_ to
defend one's self, _not_ to show anger, _not_ to lay blames.... On the
contrary, to submit even to the Evil One--to _love_ him....


36.

--We free spirits--we are the first to have the necessary prerequisite
to understanding what nineteen centuries have misunderstood--that
instinct and passion for integrity which makes war upon the "holy lie"
even more than upon all other lies.... Mankind was unspeakably far from
our benevolent and cautious neutrality, from that discipline of the
spirit which alone makes possible the solution of such strange and
subtle things: what men always sought, with shameless egoism, was their
_own_ advantage therein; they created the _church_ out of denial of the
Gospels....

Whoever sought for signs of an ironical divinity's hand in the great
drama of existence would find no small indication thereof in the
_stupendous question-mark_ that is called Christianity. That mankind
should be on its knees before the very antithesis of what was the
origin, the meaning and the _law_ of the Gospels--that in the concept of
the "church" the very things should be pronounced holy that the "bearer
of glad tidings" regards as _beneath_ him and _behind_ him--it would be
impossible to surpass this as a grand example of _world-historical
irony_--


37.

--Our age is proud of its historical sense: how, then, could it delude
itself into believing that the _crude fable of the wonder-worker and
Saviour_ constituted the beginnings of Christianity--and that everything
spiritual and symbolical in it only came later? Quite to the contrary,
the whole history of Christianity--from the death on the cross
onward--is the history of a progressively clumsier misunderstanding of
an _original_ symbolism. With every extension of Christianity among
larger and ruder masses, even less capable of grasping the principles
that gave birth to it, the need arose to make it more and more _vulgar_
and _barbarous_--it absorbed the teachings and rites of all the
_subterranean_ cults of the _imperium Romanum_, and the absurdities
engendered by all sorts of sickly reasoning. It was the fate of
Christianity that its faith had to become as sickly, as low and as
vulgar as the needs were sickly, low and vulgar to which it had to
administer. A _sickly barbarism_ finally lifts itself to power as the
church--the church, that incarnation of deadly hostility to all honesty,
to all loftiness of soul, to all discipline of the spirit, to all
spontaneous and kindly humanity.--_Christian_ values--_noble_ values: it
is only we, we _free_ spirits, who have re-established this greatest of
all antitheses in values!...


38.

--I cannot, at this place, avoid a sigh. There are days when I am
visited by a feeling blacker than the blackest melancholy--_contempt of
man_. Let me leave no doubt as to _what_ I despise, _whom_ I despise:
it is the man of today, the man with whom I am unhappily
contemporaneous. The man of today--I am suffocated by his foul
breath!... Toward the past, like all who understand, I am full of
tolerance, which is to say, _generous_ self-control: with gloomy caution
I pass through whole millenniums of this madhouse of a world, call it
"Christianity," "Christian faith" or the "Christian church," as you
will--I take care not to hold mankind responsible for its lunacies. But
my feeling changes and breaks out irresistibly the moment I enter modern
times, _our_ times. Our age _knows better_.... What was formerly merely
sickly now becomes indecent--it is indecent to be a Christian today.
_And here my disgust begins._--I look about me: not a word survives of
what was once called "truth"; we can no longer bear to hear a priest
pronounce the word. Even a man who makes the most modest pretensions to
integrity _must_ know that a theologian, a priest, a pope of today not
only errs when he speaks, but actually _lies_--and that he no longer
escapes blame for his lie through "innocence" or "ignorance." The priest
knows, as every one knows, that there is no longer any "God," or any
"sinner," or any "Saviour"--that "free will" and the "moral order of the
world" are lies--: serious reflection, the profound self-conquest of the
spirit, _allow_ no man to pretend that he does _not_ know it.... _All_
the ideas of the church are now recognized for what they are--as the
worst counterfeits in existence, invented to debase nature and all
natural values; the priest himself is seen as he actually is--as the
most dangerous form of parasite, as the venomous spider of creation....
We know, our _conscience_ now knows--just _what_ the real value of all
those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and _what ends
they have served_, with their debasement of humanity to a state of
self-pollution, the very sight of which excites loathing,--the concepts
"the other world," "the last judgment," "the immortality of the soul,"
the "soul" itself: they are all merely so many instruments of torture,
systems of cruelty, whereby the priest becomes master and remains
master.... Every one knows this, _but nevertheless things remain as
before_. What has become of the last trace of decent feeling, of
self-respect, when our statesmen, otherwise an unconventional class of
men and thoroughly anti-Christian in their acts, now call themselves
Christians and go to the communion-table?... A prince at the head of his
armies, magnificent as the expression of the egoism and arrogance of his
people--and yet acknowledging, _without_ any shame, that he is a
Christian!... Whom, then, does Christianity deny? _what_ does it call
"the world"? To be a _soldier_, to be a judge, to be a patriot; to
defend one's self; to be careful of one's honour; to desire one's own
advantage; to be _proud_ ... every act of everyday, every instinct,
every valuation that shows itself in a _deed_, is now anti-Christian:
what a _monster of falsehood_ the modern man must be to call himself
nevertheless, and _without_ shame, a Christian!--


39.

--I shall go back a bit, and tell you the _authentic_ history of
Christianity.--The very word "Christianity" is a misunderstanding--at
bottom there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross. The
"Gospels" _died_ on the cross. What, from that moment onward, was called
the "Gospels" was the very reverse of what _he_ had lived: "bad
tidings," a _Dysangelium_.[14] It is an error amounting to
nonsensicality to see in "faith," and particularly in faith in salvation
through Christ, the distinguishing mark of the Christian: only the
Christian _way of life_, the life _lived_ by him who died on the cross,
is Christian.... To this day _such_ a life is still possible, and for
_certain_ men even necessary: genuine, primitive Christianity will
remain possible in all ages.... _Not_ faith, but acts; above all, an
_avoidance_ of acts, a different _state of being_.... States of
consciousness, faith of a sort, the acceptance, for example, of anything
as true--as every psychologist knows, the value of these things is
perfectly indifferent and fifth-rate compared to that of the instincts:
strictly speaking, the whole concept of intellectual causality is false.
To reduce being a Christian, the state of Christianity, to an acceptance
of truth, to a mere phenomenon of consciousness, is to formulate the
negation of Christianity. _In fact, there are no Christians._ The
"Christian"--he who for two thousand years has passed as a Christian--is
simply a psychological self-delusion. Closely examined, it appears
that, _despite_ all his "faith," he has been ruled _only_ by his
instincts--and _what instincts_!--In all ages--for example, in the case
of Luther--"faith" has been no more than a cloak, a pretense, a _curtain_
behind which the instincts have played their game--a shrewd _blindness_
to the domination of _certain_ of the instincts.... I have already
called "faith" the specially Christian form of _shrewdness_--people
always _talk_ of their "faith" and _act_ according to their
instincts.... In the world of ideas of the Christian there is nothing
that so much as touches reality: on the contrary, one recognizes
an instinctive _hatred_ of reality as the motive power, the only motive
power at the bottom of Christianity. What follows therefrom? That even
here, in _psychologicis_, there is a radical error, which is to say one
conditioning fundamentals, which is to say, one in _substance_. Take
away one idea and put a genuine reality in its place--and the whole of
Christianity crumbles to nothingness!--Viewed calmly, this strangest of
all phenomena, a religion not only depending on errors, but inventive
and ingenious _only_ in devising injurious errors, poisonous to life
and to the heart--this remains a _spectacle for the gods_--for those
gods who are also philosophers, and whom I have encountered, for
example, in the celebrated dialogues at Naxos. At the moment when their
_disgust_ leaves them (--and us!) they will be thankful for the
spectacle afforded by the Christians: perhaps because of _this_ curious
exhibition alone the wretched little planet called the earth deserves a
glance from omnipotence, a show of divine interest.... Therefore, let us
not underestimate the Christians: the Christian, false _to the point of
innocence_, is far above the ape--in its application to the Christians a
well-known theory of descent becomes a mere piece of politeness....

[14] So in the text. One of Nietzsche's numerous coinages, obviously
suggested by _Evangelium_, the German for _gospel_.


40.

--The fate of the Gospels was decided by death--it hung on the "cross."...
It was only death, that unexpected and shameful death; it was only
the cross, which was usually reserved for the canaille only--it was only
this appalling paradox which brought the disciples face to face with the
real riddle: "_Who was it? what was it_?"--The feeling of dismay, of
profound affront and injury; the suspicion that such a death might
involve a _refutation_ of their cause; the terrible question, "Why just
in this way?"--this state of mind is only too easy to understand. Here
everything _must_ be accounted for as necessary; everything must have a
meaning, a reason, the highest sort of reason; the love of a disciple
excludes all chance. Only then did the chasm of doubt yawn: "_Who_ put
him to death? who was his natural enemy?"--this question flashed like a
lightning-stroke. Answer: dominant Judaism, its ruling class. From that
moment, one found one's self in revolt _against_ the established order,
and began to understand Jesus as _in revolt against the established
order_. Until then this militant, this nay-saying, nay-doing element in
his character had been lacking; what is more, he had appeared to present
its opposite. Obviously, the little community had _not_ understood what
was precisely the most important thing of all: the example offered by
this way of dying, the freedom from and superiority to every feeling of
_ressentiment_--a plain indication of how little he was understood at
all! All that Jesus could hope to accomplish by his death, in itself,
was to offer the strongest possible proof, or _example_, of his
teachings in the most public manner.... But his disciples were very far
from _forgiving_ his death--though to have done so would have accorded
with the Gospels in the highest degree; and neither were they prepared
to _offer_ themselves, with gentle and serene calmness of heart, for a
similar death.... On the contrary, it was precisely the most
unevangelical of feelings, _revenge_, that now possessed them. It seemed
impossible that the cause should perish with his death: "recompense" and
"judgment" became necessary (--yet what could be less evangelical than
"recompense," "punishment," and "sitting in judgment"!). Once more the
popular belief in the coming of a messiah appeared in the foreground;
attention was rivetted upon an historical moment: the "kingdom of God"
is to come, with judgment upon his enemies.... But in all this there was
a wholesale misunderstanding: imagine the "kingdom of God" as a last
act, as a mere promise! The Gospels had been, in fact, the incarnation,
the fulfilment, the _realization_ of this "kingdom of God." It was only
now that all the familiar contempt for and bitterness against Pharisees
and theologians began to appear in the character of the Master--he was
thereby _turned_ into a Pharisee and theologian himself! On the other
hand, the savage veneration of these completely unbalanced souls could
no longer endure the Gospel doctrine, taught by Jesus, of the equal
right of all men to be children of God: their revenge took the form of
_elevating_ Jesus in an extravagant fashion, and thus separating him
from themselves: just as, in earlier times, the Jews, to revenge
themselves upon their enemies, separated themselves from their God, and
placed him on a great height. The One God and the Only Son of God: both
were products of _ressentiment_....


41.

--And from that time onward an absurd problem offered itself: "how
_could_ God allow it!" To which the deranged reason of the little
community formulated an answer that was terrifying in its absurdity: God
gave his son as a _sacrifice_ for the forgiveness of sins. At once there
was an end of the gospels! Sacrifice for sin, and in its most obnoxious
and barbarous form: sacrifice of the _innocent_ for the sins of the
guilty! What appalling paganism!--Jesus himself had done away with the
very concept of "guilt," he denied that there was any gulf fixed between
God and man; he _lived_ this unity between God and man, and that was
precisely _his_ "glad tidings".... And _not_ as a mere privilege!--From
this time forward the type of the Saviour was corrupted, bit by bit, by
the doctrine of judgment and of the second coming, the doctrine of death
as a sacrifice, the doctrine of the _resurrection_, by means of which
the entire concept of "blessedness," the whole and only reality of the
gospels, is juggled away--in favour of a state of existence _after_
death!... St. Paul, with that rabbinical impudence which shows itself in
all his doings, gave a logical quality to that conception, that
_indecent_ conception, in this way: "_If_ Christ did not rise from the
dead, then all our faith is in vain!"--And at once there sprang from the
Gospels the most contemptible of all unfulfillable promises, the
_shameless_ doctrine of personal immortality.... Paul even preached it
as a _reward_....


42.

One now begins to see just _what_ it was that came to an end with the
death on the cross: a new and thoroughly original effort to found a
Buddhistic peace movement, and so establish _happiness on earth_--real,
_not_ merely promised. For this remains--as I have already pointed
out--the essential difference between the two religions of _décadence_:
Buddhism promises nothing, but actually fulfils; Christianity promises
everything, but _fulfils nothing_.--Hard upon the heels of the "glad
tidings" came the worst imaginable: those of Paul. In Paul is incarnated
the very opposite of the "bearer of glad tidings"; he represents the
genius for hatred, the vision of hatred, the relentless logic of hatred.
_What_, indeed, has not this dysangelist sacrificed to hatred! Above
all, the Saviour: he nailed him to _his own_ cross. The life, the
example, the teaching, the death of Christ, the meaning and the law of
the whole gospels--nothing was left of all this after that counterfeiter
in hatred had reduced it to his uses. Surely _not_ reality; surely _not_
historical truth!... Once more the priestly instinct of the Jew
perpetrated the same old master crime against history--he simply struck
out the yesterday and the day before yesterday of Christianity, and
_invented his own history of Christian beginnings_. Going further, he
treated the history of Israel to another falsification, so that it
became a mere prologue to _his_ achievement: all the prophets, it now
appeared, had referred to _his_ "Saviour."... Later on the church even
falsified the history of man in order to make it a prologue to
Christianity.... The figure of the Saviour, his teaching, his way of
life, his death, the meaning of his death, even the consequences of his
death--nothing remained untouched, nothing remained in even remote
contact with reality. Paul simply shifted the centre of gravity of that
whole life to a place _behind_ this existence--in the _lie_ of the
"risen" Jesus. At bottom, he had no use for the life of the
Saviour--what he needed was the death on the cross, _and_ something
more. To see anything honest in such a man as Paul, whose home was at
the centre of the Stoical enlightenment, when he converts an
hallucination into a _proof_ of the resurrection of the Saviour, or even
to believe his tale that he suffered from this hallucination
himself--this would be a genuine _niaiserie_ in a psychologist. Paul
willed the end; _therefore_ he also willed the means.... What he himself
didn't believe was swallowed readily enough by the idiots among whom he
spread _his_ teaching.--What _he_ wanted was power; in Paul the priest
once more reached out for power--he had use only for such concepts,
teachings and symbols as served the purpose of tyrannizing over the
masses and organizing mobs. _What_ was the only part of Christianity
that Mohammed borrowed later on? Paul's invention, his device for
establishing priestly tyranny and organizing the mob: the belief in the
immortality of the soul--_that is to say, the doctrine of
"judgment"_....


43.

When the centre of gravity of life is placed, _not_ in life itself, but
in "the beyond"--in _nothingness_--then one has taken away its centre of
gravity altogether. The vast lie of personal immortality destroys all
reason, all natural instinct--henceforth, everything in the instincts
that is beneficial, that fosters life and that safeguards the future is
a cause of suspicion. So to live that life no longer has any meaning:
_this_ is now the "meaning" of life.... Why be public-spirited? Why take
any pride in descent and forefathers? Why labour together, trust one
another, or concern one's self about the common welfare, and try to
serve it?... Merely so many "temptations," so many strayings from the
"straight path."--"_One_ thing only is necessary".... That every man,
because he has an "immortal soul," is as good as every other man; that
in an infinite universe of things the "salvation" of _every_ individual
may lay claim to eternal importance; that insignificant bigots and the
three-fourths insane may assume that the laws of nature are constantly
_suspended_ in their behalf--it is impossible to lavish too much
contempt upon such a magnification of every sort of selfishness to
infinity, to _insolence_. And yet Christianity has to thank precisely
_this_ miserable flattery of personal vanity for its _triumph_--it was
thus that it lured all the botched, the dissatisfied, the fallen upon
evil days, the whole refuse and off-scouring of humanity to its side.
The "salvation of the soul"--in plain English: "the world revolves
around _me_."... The poisonous doctrine, "_equal_ rights for all," has
been propagated as a Christian principle: out of the secret nooks and
crannies of bad instinct Christianity has waged a deadly war upon all
feelings of reverence and distance between man and man, which is to
say, upon the first _prerequisite_ to every step upward, to every
development of civilization--out of the _ressentiment_ of the masses it
has forged its chief weapons against _us_, against everything noble,
joyous and high-spirited on earth, against our happiness on earth.... To
allow "immortality" to every Peter and Paul was the greatest, the most
vicious outrage upon _noble_ humanity ever perpetrated.--_And_ let us
not underestimate the fatal influence that Christianity has had, even
upon politics! Nowadays no one has courage any more for special rights,
for the right of dominion, for feelings of honourable pride in himself
and his equals--for the _pathos of distance_.... Our politics is sick
with this lack of courage!--The aristocratic attitude of mind has been
undermined by the lie of the equality of souls; and if belief in the
"privileges of the majority" makes and _will continue to make_
revolutions--it is Christianity, let us not doubt, and _Christian_
valuations, which convert every revolution into a carnival of blood and
crime! Christianity is a revolt of all creatures that creep on the
ground against everything that is _lofty_: the gospel of the "lowly"
_lowers_....


44.

--The gospels are invaluable as evidence of the corruption that was
already persistent _within_ the primitive community. That which Paul,
with the cynical logic of a rabbi, later developed to a conclusion was
at bottom merely a process of decay that had begun with the death of the
Saviour.--These gospels cannot be read too carefully; difficulties lurk
behind every word. I confess--I hope it will not be held against
me--that it is precisely for this reason that they offer first-rate joy
to a psychologist--as the _opposite_ of all merely naïve corruption, as
refinement _par excellence_, as an artistic triumph in psychological
corruption. The gospels, in fact, stand alone. The Bible as a whole is
not to be compared to them. Here we are among Jews: this is the _first_
thing to be borne in mind if we are not to lose the thread of the
matter. This positive genius for conjuring up a delusion of personal
"holiness" unmatched anywhere else, either in books or by men; this
elevation of fraud in word and attitude to the level of an _art_--all
this is not an accident due to the chance talents of an individual, or
to any violation of nature. The thing responsible is _race_. The whole
of Judaism appears in Christianity as the art of concocting holy lies,
and there, after many centuries of earnest Jewish training and hard
practice of Jewish technic, the business comes to the stage of mastery.
The Christian, that _ultima ratio_ of lying, is the Jew all over
again--he is _threefold_ the Jew.... The underlying will to make use
only of such concepts, symbols and attitudes as fit into priestly
practice, the instinctive repudiation of every _other_ mode of thought,
and every other method of estimating values and utilities--this is not
only tradition, it is _inheritance_: only as an inheritance is it able
to operate with the force of nature. The whole of mankind, even the best
minds of the best ages (with one exception, perhaps hardly human--),
have permitted themselves to be deceived. The gospels have been read as
a _book of innocence_ ... surely no small indication of the high skill
with which the trick has been done.--Of course, if we could actually
_see_ these astounding bigots and bogus saints, even if only for an
instant, the farce would come to an end,--and it is precisely because
_I_ cannot read a word of theirs without seeing their attitudinizing
that _I have made an end of them_.... I simply cannot endure the way
they have of rolling up their eyes.--For the majority, happily enough,
books are mere _literature_.--Let us not be led astray: they say "judge
not," and yet they condemn to hell whoever stands in their way. In
letting God sit in judgment they judge themselves; in glorifying God
they glorify themselves; in _demanding_ that every one show the virtues
which they themselves happen to be capable of--still more, which they
_must_ have in order to remain on top--they assume the grand air of men
struggling for virtue, of men engaging in a war that virtue may prevail.
"We live, we die, we sacrifice ourselves _for the good_" (--"the truth,"
"the light," "the kingdom of God"): in point of fact, they simply do
what they cannot help doing. Forced, like hypocrites, to be sneaky, to
hide in corners, to slink along in the shadows, they convert their
necessity into a _duty_: it is on grounds of duty that they account for
their lives of humility, and that humility becomes merely one more proof
of their piety.... Ah, that humble, chaste, charitable brand of fraud!
"Virtue itself shall bear witness for us."... One may read the gospels
as books of _moral_ seduction: these petty folks fasten themselves to
morality--they know the uses of morality! Morality is the best of all
devices for leading mankind _by the nose_!--The fact is that the
conscious conceit of the chosen here disguises itself as modesty: it is
in this way that _they_, the "community," the "good and just," range
themselves, once and for always, on one side, the side of "the
truth"--and the rest of mankind, "the world," on the other.... In _that_
we observe the most fatal sort of megalomania that the earth has ever
seen: little abortions of bigots and liars began to claim exclusive
rights in the concepts of "God," "the truth," "the light," "the spirit,"
"love," "wisdom" and "life," as if these things were synonyms of
themselves and thereby they sought to fence themselves off from the
"world"; little super-Jews, ripe for some sort of madhouse, turned
values upside down in order to meet _their_ notions, just as if the
Christian were the meaning, the salt, the standard and even the _last
judgment_ of all the rest.... The whole disaster was only made possible
by the fact that there already existed in the world a similar
megalomania, allied to this one in race, to wit, the _Jewish_: once a
chasm began to yawn between Jews and Judaeo-Christians, the latter had
no choice but to employ the self-preservative measures that the Jewish
instinct had devised, even _against_ the Jews themselves, whereas the
Jews had employed them only against non-Jews. The Christian is simply a
Jew of the "reformed" confession.--


45.

--I offer a few examples of the sort of thing these petty people have
got into their heads--what they have _put into the mouth_ of the Master:
the unalloyed creed of "beautiful souls."--

"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart
thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them.
Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha
in the day of judgment, than for that city" (Mark vi, 11)--How
_evangelical_!...

"And whosoever shall offend one of _these_ little ones that believe in
me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
and he were cast into the sea" (Mark ix, 42).--How _evangelical_!...

"And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for
thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes
to be cast into hell fire; Where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not
quenched." (Mark ix, 47.[15])--It is not exactly the eye that is
meant....

[15] To which, without mentioning it, Nietzsche adds verse 48.

"Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here,
which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God
come with power." (Mark ix, 1.)--Well _lied_, lion![16]...

[16] A paraphrase of Demetrius' "Well roar'd, Lion!" in act v, scene 1
of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." The lion, of course, is the familiar
Christian symbol for Mark.

"Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
cross, and follow me. _For_..." (_Note of a psychologist._ Christian
morality is refuted by its _fors_: its reasons are against it,--this
makes it Christian.) Mark viii, 34.--

"Judge not, that ye be not judged. With what measure ye mete, it shall
be measured to you again." (Matthew vii, 1.[17])--What a notion of
justice, of a "just" judge!...

[17] Nietzsche also quotes part of verse 2.

"For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even
the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye
more _than others_? do not even the publicans so?" (Matthew v,
46.[18])--Principle of "Christian love": it insists upon being well
_paid_ in the end....

[18] The quotation also includes verse 47.

"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father
forgive your trespasses." (Matthew vi, 15.)--Very compromising for the
said "father."...

"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all
these things shall be added unto you." (Matthew vi, 33.)--All these
things: namely, food, clothing, all the necessities of life. An _error_,
to put it mildly.... A bit before this God appears as a tailor, at least
in certain cases....

"Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward _is_
great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the
prophets." (Luke vi, 23.)--_Impudent_ rabble! It compares itself to the
prophets....

"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and _that_ the spirit of God
dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, _him shall God
destroy_; for the temple of God is holy, _which temple ye are_." (Paul,
1 Corinthians iii, 16.[19])--For that sort of thing one cannot have
enough contempt....

[19] And 17.

"Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world
shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
(Paul, 1 Corinthians vi, 2.)--Unfortunately, not merely the speech of
a lunatic.... This _frightful impostor_ then proceeds: "Know ye not
that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this

"Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in
the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by
the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.... Not many wise
men after the flesh, not men mighty, not many noble _are called_: But
God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise;
and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things
which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are
despised, hath God chosen, _yea_, and things which are not, to bring to
nought things that are: That no flesh should glory in his presence."
(Paul, 1 Corinthians i, 20ff.[20])--In order to _understand_ this
passage, a first-rate example of the psychology underlying every
Chandala-morality, one should read the first part of my "Genealogy of
Morals": there, for the first time, the antagonism between a _noble_
morality and a morality born of _ressentiment_ and impotent vengefulness
is exhibited. Paul was the greatest of all apostles of revenge....

--_What follows, then?_ That one had better put on gloves before reading
the New Testament. The presence of so much filth makes it very
advisable. One would as little choose "early Christians" for companions
as Polish Jews: not that one need seek out an objection to them....
Neither has a pleasant smell.--I have searched the New Testament in vain
for a single sympathetic touch; nothing is there that is free, kindly,
open-hearted or upright. In it humanity does not even make the first
step upward--the instinct for _cleanliness_ is lacking.... Only _evil_
instincts are there, and there is not even the courage of these evil
instincts. It is all cowardice; it is all a shutting of the eyes, a
self-deception. Every other book becomes clean, once one has read the
New Testament: for example, immediately after reading Paul I took up
with delight that most charming and wanton of scoffers, Petronius, of
whom one may say what Domenico Boccaccio wrote of Cæsar Borgia to the
Duke of Parma: "_è tutto festo_"--immortally healthy, immortally
cheerful and sound.... These petty bigots make a capital miscalculation.
They attack, but everything they attack is thereby _distinguished_.
Whoever is attacked by an "early Christian" is surely _not_ befouled....
On the contrary, it is an honour to have an "early Christian" as an
opponent. One cannot read the New Testament without acquired admiration
for whatever it abuses--not to speak of the "wisdom of this world,"
which an impudent wind-bag tries to dispose of "by the foolishness of
preaching."... Even the scribes and pharisees are benefitted by such
opposition: they must certainly have been worth something to have been
hated in such an indecent manner. Hypocrisy--as if this were a charge
that the "early Christians" _dared_ to make!--After all, they were the
_privileged_, and that was enough: the hatred of the Chandala needed no
other excuse. The "early Christian"--and also, I fear, the "last
Christian," _whom I may perhaps live to see_--is a rebel against all
privilege by profound instinct--he lives and makes war for ever for
"equal rights."... Strictly speaking, he has no alternative. When a man
proposes to represent, in his own person, the "chosen of God"--or to be
a "temple of God," or a "judge of the angels"--then every _other_
criterion, whether based upon honesty, upon intellect, upon manliness
and pride, or upon beauty and freedom of the heart, becomes simply
"worldly"--_evil in itself_.... Moral: every word that comes from the
lips of an "early Christian" is a lie, and his every act is
instinctively dishonest--all his values, all his aims are noxious, but
_whoever_ he hates, _whatever_ he hates, has real _value_.... The
Christian, and particularly the Christian priest, is thus a _criterion
of values_.

--Must I add that, in the whole New Testament, there appears but a
_solitary_ figure worthy of honour? Pilate, the Roman viceroy. To regard
a Jewish imbroglio _seriously_--that was quite beyond him. One Jew more
or less--what did it matter?... The noble scorn of a Roman, before whom
the word "truth" was shamelessly mishandled, enriched the New Testament
with the only saying _that has any value_--and that is at once its
criticism and its _destruction_: "What is truth?..."


47.

--The thing that sets us apart is not that we are unable to find God,
either in history, or in nature, or behind nature--but that we regard
what has been honoured as God, not as "divine," but as pitiable, as
absurd, as injurious; not as a mere error, but as a _crime against
life_.... We deny that God is God.... If any one were to _show_ us this
Christian God, we'd be still less inclined to believe in him.--In a
formula: _deus, qualem Paulus creavit, dei negatio_.--Such a religion as
Christianity, which does not touch reality at a single point and which
goes to pieces the moment reality asserts its rights at any point, must
be inevitably the deadly enemy of the "wisdom of this world," which is
to say, of _science_--and it will give the name of good to whatever
means serve to poison, calumniate and _cry down_ all intellectual
discipline, all lucidity and strictness in matters of intellectual
conscience, and all noble coolness and freedom of the mind. "Faith," as
an imperative, vetoes science--_in praxi_, lying at any price.... Paul
_well knew_ that lying--that "faith"--was necessary; later on the church
borrowed the fact from Paul.--The God that Paul invented for himself, a
God who "reduced to absurdity" "the wisdom of this world" (especially
the two great enemies of superstition, philology and medicine), is in
truth only an indication of Paul's resolute _determination_ to
accomplish that very thing himself: to give one's own will the name of
God, _thora_--that is essentially Jewish. Paul _wants_ to dispose of the
"wisdom of this world": his enemies are the _good_ philologians and
physicians of the Alexandrine school--on them he makes his war. As a
matter of fact no man can be a _philologian_ or a physician without
being also _Antichrist_. That is to say, as a philologian a man sees
_behind_ the "holy books," and as a physician he sees _behind_ the
physiological degeneration of the typical Christian. The physician says
"incurable"; the philologian says "fraud."...

--Has any one ever clearly understood the celebrated story at the
beginning of the Bible--of God's mortal terror of _science_?... No one,
in fact, has understood it. This priest-book _par excellence_ opens, as
is fitting, with the great inner difficulty of the priest: _he_ faces
only one great danger; _ergo_, "God" faces only one great danger.--

The old God, wholly "spirit," wholly the high-priest, wholly perfect, is
promenading his garden: he is bored and trying to kill time. Against
boredom even gods struggle in vain.[21] What does he do? He creates
man--man is entertaining.... But then he notices that man is also bored.
God's pity for the only form of distress that invades all paradises
knows no bounds: so he forthwith creates other animals. God's first
mistake: to man these other animals were not entertaining--he sought
dominion over them; he did not want to be an "animal" himself.--So God
created woman. In the act he brought boredom to an end--and also many
other things! Woman was the _second_ mistake of God.--"Woman, at bottom,
is a serpent, Heva"--every priest knows that; "from woman comes every
evil in the world"--every priest knows that, too. _Ergo_, she is also to
blame for _science_.... It was through woman that man learned to taste
of the tree of knowledge.--What happened? The old God was seized by
mortal terror. Man himself had been his _greatest_ blunder; he had
created a rival to himself; science makes men _godlike_--it is all up
with priests and gods when man becomes scientific!--_Moral_: science is
the forbidden _per se_; it alone is forbidden. Science is the _first_ of
sins, the germ of all sins, the _original_ sin. _This is all there is of
morality._--"Thou shall _not_ know":--the rest follows from that.--God's
mortal terror, however, did not hinder him from being shrewd. How is one
to _protect_ one's self against science? For a long while this was the
capital problem. Answer: Out of paradise with man! Happiness, leisure,
foster thought--and all thoughts are bad thoughts!--Man _must_ not
think.--And so the priest invents distress, death, the mortal dangers of
childbirth, all sorts of misery, old age, decrepitude, above all,
_sickness_--nothing but devices for making war on science! The troubles
of man don't _allow_ him to think.... Nevertheless--how terrible!--, the
edifice of knowledge begins to tower aloft, invading heaven, shadowing
the gods--what is to be done?--The old God invents _war_; he separates
the peoples; he makes men destroy one another (--the priests have always
had need of war....). War--among other things, a great disturber of
science!--Incredible! Knowledge, _deliverance from the priests_,
prospers in spite of war.--So the old God comes to his final resolution:
"Man has become scientific--_there is no help for it: he must be
drowned!_"...

[21] A paraphrase of Schiller's "Against stupidity even gods struggle in
vain."


49.

--I have been understood. At the opening of the Bible there is the
_whole_ psychology of the priest.--The priest knows of only one great
danger: that is science--the sound comprehension of cause and effect.
But science flourishes, on the whole, only under favourable
conditions--a man must have time, he must have an _overflowing_
intellect, in order to "know."... "_Therefore_, man must be made
unhappy,"--this has been, in all ages, the logic of the priest.--It is
easy to see just _what_, by this logic, was the first thing to come into
the world:--"_sin_."... The concept of guilt and punishment, the whole
"moral order of the world," was set up _against_ science--_against_ the
deliverance of man from priests.... Man must _not_ look outward; he must
look inward. He must _not_ look at things shrewdly and cautiously, to
learn about them; he must not look at all; he must _suffer_.... And he
must suffer so much that he is always in need of the priest.--Away with
physicians! _What is needed is a Saviour._--The concept of guilt and
punishment, including the doctrines of "grace," of "salvation," of
"forgiveness"--_lies_ through and through, and absolutely without
psychological reality--were devised to destroy man's _sense of
causality_: they are an attack upon the concept of cause and
effect!--And _not_ an attack with the fist, with the knife, with honesty
in hate and love! On the contrary, one inspired by the most cowardly,
the most crafty, the most ignoble of instincts! An attack of _priests_!
An attack of _parasites_! The vampirism of pale, subterranean
leeches!... When the natural consequences of an act are no longer
"natural," but are regarded as produced by the ghostly creations of
superstition--by "God," by "spirits," by "souls"--and reckoned as merely
"moral" consequences, as rewards, as punishments, as hints, as lessons,
then the whole ground-work of knowledge is destroyed--_then the greatest
of crimes against humanity has been perpetrated_.--I repeat that sin,
man's self-desecration _par excellence_, was invented in order to make
science, culture, and every elevation and ennobling of man impossible;
the priest _rules_ through the invention of sin.--


50.

--In this place I can't permit myself to omit a psychology of "belief,"
of the "believer," for the special benefit of "believers." If there
remain any today who do not yet know how _indecent_ it is to be
"believing"--_or_ how much a sign of _décadence_, of a broken will to
live--then they will know it well enough tomorrow. My voice reaches even
the deaf.--It appears, unless I have been incorrectly informed, that
there prevails among Christians a sort of criterion of truth that is
called "proof by power." "Faith makes blessed: _therefore_ it is
true."--It might be objected right here that blessedness is not
demonstrated, it is merely _promised_: it hangs upon "faith" as a
condition--one _shall_ be blessed _because_ one believes.... But what of
the thing that the priest promises to the believer, the wholly
transcendental "beyond"--how is _that_ to be demonstrated?--The "proof
by power," thus assumed, is actually no more at bottom than a belief
that the effects which faith promises will not fail to appear. In a
formula: "I believe that faith makes for blessedness--_therefore_, it is
true."... But this is as far as we may go. This "therefore" would be
_absurdum_ itself as a criterion of truth.--But let us admit, for the
sake of politeness, that blessedness by faith may be demonstrated
(--_not_ merely hoped for, and _not_ merely promised by the suspicious
lips of a priest): even so, _could_ blessedness--in a technical term,
_pleasure_--ever be a proof of truth? So little is this true that it is
almost a proof against truth when sensations of pleasure influence the
answer to the question "What is true?" or, at all events, it is enough
to make that "truth" highly suspicious. The proof by "pleasure" is a
proof _of_ "pleasure"--nothing more; why in the world should it be
assumed that _true_ judgments give more pleasure than false ones, and
that, in conformity to some pre-established harmony, they necessarily
bring agreeable feelings in their train?--The experience of all
disciplined and profound minds teaches _the contrary_. Man has had to
fight for every atom of the truth, and has had to pay for it almost
everything that the heart, that human love, that human trust cling to.
Greatness of soul is needed for this business: the service of truth is
the hardest of all services.--What, then, is the meaning of _integrity_
in things intellectual? It means that a man must be severe with his own
heart, that he must scorn "beautiful feelings," and that he makes every
Yea and Nay a matter of conscience!--Faith makes blessed: _therefore_,
it lies....


51.

The fact that faith, under certain circumstances, may work for
blessedness, but that this blessedness produced by an _idée fixe_ by no
means makes the idea itself true, and the fact that faith actually moves
no mountains, but instead _raises them up_ where there were none before:
all this is made sufficiently clear by a walk through a _lunatic
asylum_. _Not_, of course, to a priest: for his instincts prompt him to
the lie that sickness is not sickness and lunatic asylums not lunatic
asylums. Christianity finds sickness _necessary_, just as the Greek
spirit had need of a superabundance of health--the actual ulterior
purpose of the whole system of salvation of the church is to _make_
people ill. And the church itself--doesn't it set up a Catholic lunatic
asylum as the ultimate ideal?--The whole earth as a madhouse?--The sort
of religious man that the church _wants_ is a typical _décadent_; the
moment at which a religious crisis dominates a people is always marked
by epidemics of nervous disorder; the "inner world" of the religious man
is so much like the "inner world" of the overstrung and exhausted that
it is difficult to distinguish between them; the "highest" states of
mind, held up before mankind by Christianity as of supreme worth, are
actually epileptoid in form--the church has granted the name of holy
only to lunatics or to gigantic frauds _in majorem dei honorem_.... Once
I ventured to designate the whole Christian system of _training_[22] in
penance and salvation (now best studied in England) as a method of
producing a _folie circulaire_ upon a soil already prepared for it,
which is to say, a soil thoroughly unhealthy. Not every one may be a
Christian: one is not "converted" to Christianity--one must first
be sick enough for it.... We others, who have the _courage_ for health
_and_ likewise for contempt,--we may well despise a religion that
teaches misunderstanding of the body! that refuses to rid itself of the
superstition about the soul! that makes a "virtue" of insufficient
nourishment! that combats health as a sort of enemy, devil, temptation!
that persuades itself that it is possible to carry about a "perfect
soul" in a cadaver of a body, and that, to this end, had to devise for
itself a new concept of "perfection," a pale, sickly, idiotically
ecstatic state of existence, so-called "holiness"--a holiness that is
itself merely a series of symptoms of an impoverished, enervated and
incurably disordered body!... The Christian movement, as a European
movement, was from the start no more than a general uprising of all
sorts of outcast and refuse elements (--who now, under cover of
Christianity, aspire to power). It does _not_ represent the decay of a
race; it represents, on the contrary, a conglomeration of _décadence_
products from all directions, crowding together and seeking one another
out. It was _not_, as has been thought, the corruption of antiquity, of
_noble_ antiquity, which made Christianity possible; one cannot too
sharply challenge the learned imbecility which today maintains that
theory. At the time when the sick and rotten Chandala classes in the
whole _imperium_ were Christianized, the _contrary type_, the nobility,
reached its finest and ripest development. The majority became master;
democracy, with its Christian instincts, _triumphed_.... Christianity
was not "national," it was not based on race--it appealed to all the
varieties of men disinherited by life, it had its allies everywhere.
Christianity has the rancour of the sick at its very core--the instinct
against the _healthy_, against _health_. Everything that is
well-constituted, proud, gallant and, above all, beautiful gives offence
to its ears and eyes. Again I remind you of Paul's priceless saying:
"And God hath chosen the _weak_ things of the world, the _foolish_
things of the world, the _base_ things of the world, and things which
are _despised_":[23] _this_ was the formula; _in hoc signo_ the
_décadence_ triumphed.--_God on the cross_--is man always to miss the
frightful inner significance of this symbol?--Everything that suffers,
everything that hangs on the cross, is _divine_.... We all hang on the
cross, consequently _we_ are divine.... We alone are divine....
Christianity was thus a victory: a nobler attitude of mind was destroyed
by it--Christianity remains to this day the greatest misfortune of
humanity.--

[22] The word _training_ is in English in the text.

[23] 1 Corinthians i, 27, 28.


52.

Christianity also stands in opposition to all _intellectual_
well-being,--sick reasoning is the only sort that it _can_ use as
Christian reasoning; it takes the side of everything that is idiotic; it
pronounces a curse upon "intellect," upon the _superbia_ of the healthy
intellect. Since sickness is inherent in Christianity, it follows that
the typically Christian state of "faith" _must_ be a form of sickness
too, and that all straight, straightforward and scientific paths to
knowledge _must_ be banned by the church as _forbidden_ ways. Doubt is
thus a sin from the start.... The complete lack of psychological
cleanliness in the priest--revealed by a glance at him--is a phenomenon
_resulting_ from _décadence_,--one may observe in hysterical women and
in rachitic children how regularly the falsification of instincts,
delight in lying for the mere sake of lying, and incapacity for looking
straight and walking straight are symptoms of _décadence_. "Faith"
means the will to avoid knowing what is true. The pietist, the priest of
either sex, is a fraud _because_ he is sick: his instinct _demands_ that
the truth shall never be allowed its rights on any point. "Whatever
makes for illness is _good_; whatever issues from abundance, from
superabundance, from power, is _evil_": so argues the believer. The
_impulse to lie_--it is by this that I recognize every foreordained
theologian.--Another characteristic of the theologian is his _unfitness
for philology_. What I here mean by philology is, in a general sense,
the art of reading with profit--the capacity for absorbing facts
_without_ interpreting them falsely, and _without_ losing caution,
patience and subtlety in the effort to understand them. Philology as
_ephexis_[24] in interpretation: whether one be dealing with books, with
newspaper reports, with the most fateful events or with weather
statistics--not to mention the "salvation of the soul."... The way in
which a theologian, whether in Berlin or in Rome, is ready to explain,
say, a "passage of Scripture," or an experience, or a victory by the
national army, by turning upon it the high illumination of the Psalms of
David, is always so _daring_ that it is enough to make a philologian run
up a wall. But what shall he do when pietists and other such cows from
Suabia[25] use the "finger of God" to convert their miserably
commonplace and huggermugger existence into a miracle of "grace," a
"providence" and an "experience of salvation"? The most modest exercise
of the intellect, not to say of decency, should certainly be enough to
convince these interpreters of the perfect childishness and unworthiness
of such a misuse of the divine digital dexterity. However small our
piety, if we ever encountered a god who always cured us of a cold in the
head at just the right time, or got us into our carriage at the very
instant heavy rain began to fall, he would seem so absurd a god that
he'd have to be abolished even if he existed. God as a domestic servant,
as a letter carrier, as an almanac-man--at bottom, he is a mere name for
the stupidest sort of chance.... "Divine Providence," which every third
man in "educated Germany" still believes in, is so strong an argument
against God that it would be impossible to think of a stronger. And in
any case it is an argument against Germans!...

[24] That is, to say, scepticism. Among the Greeks scepticism was also
occasionally called ephecticism.

Biblical criticism. The leader of this school was F. C. Baur, and one of

--It is so little true that _martyrs_ offer any support to the truth of
a cause that I am inclined to deny that any martyr has ever had anything
to do with the truth at all. In the very tone in which a martyr flings
what he fancies to be true at the head of the world there appears so low
a grade of intellectual honesty and such _insensibility_ to the problem
of "truth," that it is never necessary to refute him. Truth is not
something that one man has and another man has not: at best, only
peasants, or peasant-apostles like Luther, can think of truth in any
such way. One may rest assured that the greater the degree of a man's
intellectual conscience the greater will be his modesty, his
_discretion_, on this point. To _know_ in five cases, and to refuse,
with delicacy, to know anything _further_.... "Truth," as the word is
understood by every prophet, every sectarian, every free-thinker, every
Socialist and every churchman, is simply a complete proof that not even
a beginning has been made in the intellectual discipline and
self-control that are necessary to the unearthing of even the smallest
truth.--The deaths of the martyrs, it may be said in passing, have been
misfortunes of history: they have _misled_.... The conclusion that all
idiots, women and plebeians come to, that there must be something in a
cause for which any one goes to his death (or which, as under primitive
Christianity, sets off epidemics of death-seeking)--this conclusion has
been an unspeakable drag upon the testing of facts, upon the whole
spirit of inquiry and investigation. The martyrs have _damaged_ the
truth.... Even to this day the crude fact of persecution is enough to
give an honourable name to the most empty sort of sectarianism.--But
why? Is the worth of a cause altered by the fact that some one had laid
down his life for it?--An error that becomes honourable is simply an
error that has acquired one seductive charm the more: do you suppose,
Messrs. Theologians, that we shall give you the chance to be martyred
for your lies?--One best disposes of a cause by respectfully putting it
on ice--that is also the best way to dispose of theologians.... This was
precisely the world-historical stupidity of all the persecutors: that
they gave the appearance of honour to the cause they opposed--that they
made it a present of the fascination of martyrdom.... Women are still on
their knees before an error because they have been told that some one
died on the cross for it. _Is the cross, then, an argument?_--But about
all these things there is one, and one only, who has said what has been
needed for thousands of years--_Zarathustra_.

     They made signs in blood along the way that they went, and their
     folly taught them that the truth is proved by blood.

     But blood is the worst of all testimonies to the truth; blood
     poisoneth even the purest teaching and turneth it into madness and
     hatred in the heart.

     And when one goeth through fire for his teaching--what doth that
     prove? Verily, it is more when one's teaching cometh out of one's
     own burning![26]

[26] The quotations are from "Also sprach Zarathustra" ii, 24: "Of
Priests."


54.

Do not let yourself be deceived: great intellects are sceptical.
Zarathustra is a sceptic. The strength, the _freedom_ which proceed from
intellectual power, from a superabundance of intellectual power,
_manifest_ themselves as scepticism. Men of fixed convictions do not
count when it comes to determining what is fundamental in values and
lack of values. Men of convictions are prisoners. They do not see far
enough, they do not see what is _below_ them: whereas a man who would
talk to any purpose about value and non-value must be able to see five
hundred convictions _beneath_ him--and _behind_ him.... A mind that
aspires to great things, and that wills the means thereto, is
necessarily sceptical. Freedom from any sort of conviction _belongs_ to
strength, and to an independent point of view.... That grand passion
which is at once the foundation and the power of a sceptic's existence,
and is both more enlightened and more despotic than he is himself,
drafts the whole of his intellect into its service; it makes him
unscrupulous; it gives him courage to employ unholy means; under certain
circumstances it does not _begrudge_ him even convictions. Conviction as
a means: one may achieve a good deal by means of a conviction. A grand
passion makes use of and uses up convictions; it does not yield to
them--it knows itself to be sovereign.--On the contrary, the need of
faith, of something unconditioned by yea or nay, of Carlylism, if I may
be allowed the word, is a need of _weakness_. The man of faith, the
"believer" of any sort, is necessarily a dependent man--such a man
cannot posit _himself_ as a goal, nor can he find goals within himself.
The "believer" does not belong to himself; he can only be a means to an
end; he must be _used up_; he needs some one to use him up. His instinct
gives the highest honours to an ethic of self-effacement; he is prompted
to embrace it by everything: his prudence, his experience, his vanity.
Every sort of faith is in itself an evidence of self-effacement, of
self-estrangement.... When one reflects how necessary it is to the great
majority that there be regulations to restrain them from without and
hold them fast, and to what extent control, or, in a higher sense,
_slavery_, is the one and only condition which makes for the well-being
of the weak-willed man, and especially woman, then one at once
understands conviction and "faith." To the man with convictions they are
his backbone. To _avoid_ seeing many things, to be impartial about
nothing, to be a party man through and through, to estimate all values
strictly and infallibly--these are conditions necessary to the existence
of such a man. But by the same token they are _antagonists_ of the
truthful man--of the truth.... The believer is not free to answer the
question, "true" or "not true," according to the dictates of his own
conscience: integrity on _this_ point would work his instant downfall.
The pathological limitations of his vision turn the man of convictions
into a fanatic--Savonarola, Luther, Rousseau, Robespierre,
Saint-Simon--these types stand in opposition to the strong,
_emancipated_ spirit. But the grandiose attitudes of these _sick_
intellects, these intellectual epileptics, are of influence upon the
great masses--fanatics are picturesque, and mankind prefers observing
poses to listening to _reasons_....


55.

--One step further in the psychology of conviction, of "faith." It is
now a good while since I first proposed for consideration the question
whether convictions are not even more dangerous enemies to truth than
lies. ("Human, All-Too-Human," I, aphorism 483.)[27] This time I desire
to put the question definitely: is there any actual difference between
a lie and a conviction?--All the world believes that there is; but what
is not believed by all the world!--Every conviction has its history, its
primitive forms, its stage of tentativeness and error: it _becomes_ a
conviction only after having been, for a long time, _not_ one, and then,
for an even longer time, _hardly_ one. What if falsehood be also one of
these embryonic forms of conviction?--Sometimes all that is needed is a
change in persons: what was a lie in the father becomes a conviction in
the son.--I call it lying to refuse to see what one sees, or to refuse
to see it _as_ it is: whether the lie be uttered before witnesses or not
before witnesses is of no consequence. The most common sort of lie is
that by which a man deceives himself: the deception of others is a
relatively rare offence.--Now, this will _not_ to see what one sees,
this will _not_ to see it as it is, is almost the first requisite for
all who belong to a party of whatever sort: the party man becomes
inevitably a liar. For example, the German historians are convinced that
Rome was synonymous with despotism and that the Germanic peoples brought
the spirit of liberty into the world: what is the difference between
this conviction and a lie? Is it to be wondered at that all partisans,
including the German historians, instinctively roll the fine phrases of
morality upon their tongues--that morality almost owes its very
_survival_ to the fact that the party man of every sort has need of it
every moment?--"This is _our_ conviction: we publish it to the whole
world; we live and die for it--let us respect all who have
convictions!"--I have actually heard such sentiments from the mouths of
anti-Semites. On the contrary, gentlemen! An anti-Semite surely does not
become more respectable because he lies on principle.... The priests,
who have more finesse in such matters, and who well understand the
objection that lies against the notion of a conviction, which is to say,
of a falsehood that becomes a matter of principle _because_ it serves a
purpose, have borrowed from the Jews the shrewd device of sneaking in
the concepts, "God," "the will of God" and "the revelation of God" at
this place. Kant, too, with his categorical imperative, was on the same
road: this was his _practical_ reason.[28] There are questions regarding
the truth or untruth of which it is _not_ for man to decide; all the
capital questions, all the capital problems of valuation, are beyond
human reason.... To know the limits of reason--_that_ alone is genuine
philosophy.... Why did God make a revelation to man? Would God have done
anything superfluous? Man _could_ not find out for himself what was good
and what was evil, so God taught him His will.... Moral: the priest does
_not_ lie--the question, "true" or "untrue," has nothing to do with such
things as the priest discusses; it is impossible to lie about these
things. In order to lie here it would be necessary to know _what_ is
true. But this is more than man _can_ know; therefore, the priest is
simply the mouthpiece of God.--Such a priestly syllogism
is by no means merely Jewish and Christian; the right to lie and the
_shrewd dodge_ of "revelation" belong to the general priestly type--to
the priest of the _décadence_ as well as to the priest of pagan times
(--Pagans are all those who say yes to life, and to whom "God" is a word
signifying acquiescence in all things).--The "law," the "will of God,"
the "holy book," and "inspiration"--all these things are merely words
for the conditions _under_ which the priest comes to power and _with_
which he maintains his power,--these concepts are to be found at the
bottom of all priestly organizations, and of all priestly or
priestly-philosophical schemes of governments. The "holy lie"--common
alike to Confucius, to the Code of Manu, to Mohammed and to the
Christian church--is not even wanting in Plato. "Truth is here": this
means, no matter where it is heard, _the priest lies_....

[27] The aphorism, which is headed "The Enemies of Truth," makes the
direct statement: "Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than
lies."

[28] A reference, of course, to Kant's "Kritik der praktischen Vernunft"
(Critique of Practical Reason).

--In the last analysis it comes to this: what is the _end_ of lying? The
fact that, in Christianity, "holy" ends are not visible is _my_
objection to the means it employs. Only _bad_ ends appear: the
poisoning, the calumniation, the denial of life, the despising of the
body, the degradation and self-contamination of man by the concept of
sin--_therefore_, its means are also bad.--I have a contrary feeling
when I read the Code of Manu, an incomparably more intellectual and
superior work, which it would be a sin against the _intelligence_ to so
much as _name_ in the same breath with the Bible. It is easy to see why:
there is a genuine philosophy behind it, _in_ it, not merely an
evil-smelling mess of Jewish rabbinism and superstition,--it gives even
the most fastidious psychologist something to sink his teeth into. And,
_not_ to forget what is most important, it differs fundamentally from
every kind of Bible: by means of it the _nobles_, the philosophers and
the warriors keep the whip-hand over the majority; it is full of noble
valuations, it shows a feeling of perfection, an acceptance of life, and
triumphant feeling toward self and life--the _sun_ shines upon the whole
book.--All the things on which Christianity vents its fathomless
vulgarity--for example, procreation, women and marriage--are here
handled earnestly, with reverence and with love and confidence. How can
any one really put into the hands of children and ladies a book which
contains such vile things as this: "to avoid fornication, let every man
have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband; ... it is
better to marry than to burn"?[29] And is it _possible_ to be a
Christian so long as the origin of man is Christianized, which is to
say, _befouled_, by the doctrine of the _immaculata conceptio_?... I
know of no book in which so many delicate and kindly things are said of
women as in the Code of Manu; these old grey-beards and saints have a
way of being gallant to women that it would be impossible, perhaps, to
surpass. "The mouth of a woman," it says in one place, "the breasts of a
maiden, the prayer of a child and the smoke of sacrifice are always
pure." In another place: "there is nothing purer than the light of the
sun, the shadow cast by a cow, air, water, fire and the breath of a
maiden." Finally, in still another place--perhaps this is also a holy
lie--: "all the orifices of the body above the navel are pure, and all
below are impure. Only in the maiden is the whole body pure."

One catches the _unholiness_ of Christian means _in flagranti_ by the
simple process of putting the ends sought by Christianity beside the
ends sought by the Code of Manu--by putting these enormously
antithetical ends under a strong light. The critic of Christianity
cannot evade the necessity of making Christianity _contemptible_.--A
book of laws such as the Code of Manu has the same origin as every other
good law-book: it epitomizes the experience, the sagacity and the
ethical experimentation of long centuries; it brings things to a
conclusion; it no longer creates. The prerequisite to a codification of
this sort is recognition of the fact that the means which establish the
authority of a slowly and painfully attained _truth_ are fundamentally
different from those which one would make use of to prove it. A law-book
never recites the utility, the grounds, the casuistical antecedents of a
law: for if it did so it would lose the imperative tone, the "thou
shall," on which obedience is based. The problem lies exactly here.--At
a certain point in the evolution of a people, the class within it of the
greatest insight, which is to say, the greatest hindsight and foresight,
declares that the series of experiences determining how all shall
live--or _can_ live--has come to an end. The object now is to reap as
rich and as complete a harvest as possible from the days of experiment
and _hard_ experience. In consequence, the thing that is to be avoided
above everything is further experimentation--the continuation of the
state in which values are fluent, and are tested, chosen and criticized
_ad infinitum_. Against this a double wall is set up: on the one hand,
_revelation_, which is the assumption that the reasons lying behind the
laws are _not_ of human origin, that they were _not_ sought out and
found by a slow process and after many errors, but that they are of
divine ancestry, and came into being complete, perfect, without a
history, as a free gift, a miracle...; and on the other hand,
_tradition_, which is the assumption that the law has stood unchanged
from time immemorial, and that it is impious and a crime against one's
forefathers to bring it into question. The authority of the law is thus
grounded on the thesis: God gave it, and the fathers _lived_ it.--The
higher motive of such procedure lies in the design to distract
consciousness, step by step, from its concern with notions of right
living (that is to say, those that have been _proved_ to be right by
wide and carefully considered experience), so that instinct attains to a
perfect automatism--a primary necessity to every sort of mastery, to
every sort of perfection in the art of life. To draw up such a law-book
as Manu's means to lay before a people the possibility of future
mastery, of attainable perfection--it permits them to aspire to the
highest reaches of the art of life. _To that end the thing must be made
unconscious_: that is the aim of every holy lie.--The _order of castes_,
the highest, the dominating law, is merely the ratification of an _order
of nature_, of a natural law of the first rank, over which no arbitrary
fiat, no "modern idea," can exert any influence. In every healthy
society there are three physiological types, gravitating toward
differentiation but mutually conditioning one another, and each of these
has its own hygiene, its own sphere of work, its own special mastery and
feeling of perfection. It is _not_ Manu but nature that sets off in one
class those who are chiefly intellectual, in another those who are
marked by muscular strength and temperament, and in a third those who
are distinguished in neither one way or the other, but show only
mediocrity--the last-named represents the great majority, and the first
two the select. The superior caste--I call it the _fewest_--has, as the
most perfect, the privileges of the few: it stands for happiness, for
beauty, for everything good upon earth. Only the most intellectual of
men have any right to beauty, to the beautiful; only in them can
goodness escape being weakness. _Pulchrum est paucorum hominum_:[30]
goodness is a privilege. Nothing could be more unbecoming to them than
uncouth manners or a pessimistic look, or an eye that sees
_ugliness_--or indignation against the general aspect of things.
Indignation is the privilege of the Chandala; so is pessimism. "_The
world is perfect_"--so prompts the instinct of the intellectual, the
instinct of the man who says yes to life. "Imperfection, whatever is
_inferior_ to us, distance, the pathos of distance, even the Chandala
themselves are parts of this perfection." The most intelligent men, like
the _strongest_, find their happiness where others would find only
disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with
others, in effort; their delight is in self-mastery; in them asceticism
becomes second nature, a necessity, an instinct. They regard a difficult
task as a privilege; it is to them a _recreation_ to play with burdens
that would crush all others.... Knowledge--a form of asceticism.--They
are the most honourable kind of men: but that does not prevent them
being the most cheerful and most amiable. They rule, not because they
want to, but because they _are_; they are not at liberty to play
second.--The _second caste_: to this belong the guardians of the law,
the keepers of order and security, the more noble warriors, above all,
the king as the highest form of warrior, judge and preserver of the law.
The second in rank constitute the executive arm of the intellectuals,
the next to them in rank, taking from them all that is _rough_ in the
business of ruling--their followers, their right hand, their most apt
disciples.--In all this, I repeat, there is nothing arbitrary, nothing
"made up"; whatever is to the _contrary_ is made up--by it nature is
brought to shame.... The order of castes, the _order of rank_, simply
formulates the supreme law of life itself; the separation of the three
types is necessary to the maintenance of society, and to the evolution
of higher types, and the highest types--the _inequality_ of rights is
essential to the existence of any rights at all.--A right is a
privilege. Every one enjoys the privileges that accord with his state of
existence. Let us not underestimate the privileges of the _mediocre_.
Life is always harder as one mounts the _heights_--the cold increases,
responsibility increases. A high civilization is a pyramid: it can stand
only on a broad base; its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly
consolidated mediocrity. The handicrafts, commerce, agriculture,
_science_, the greater part of art, in brief, the whole range of
_occupational_ activities, are compatible only with mediocre ability and
aspiration; such callings would be out of place for exceptional men; the
instincts which belong to them stand as much opposed to aristocracy as
to anarchism. The fact that a man is publicly useful, that he is a
wheel, a function, is evidence of a natural predisposition; it is not
_society_, but the only sort of happiness that the majority are capable
of, that makes them intelligent machines. To the mediocre mediocrity is
a form of happiness; they have a natural instinct for mastering one
thing, for specialization. It would be altogether unworthy of a profound
intellect to see anything objectionable in mediocrity in itself. It is,
in fact, the _first_ prerequisite to the appearance of the exceptional:
it is a necessary condition to a high degree of civilization. When the
exceptional man handles the mediocre man with more delicate fingers than
he applies to himself or to his equals, this is not merely kindness of
heart--it is simply his _duty_.... Whom do I hate most heartily among
the rabbles of today? The rabble of Socialists, the apostles to the
Chandala, who undermine the workingman's instincts, his pleasure, his
feeling of contentment with his petty existence--who make him envious
and teach him revenge.... Wrong never lies in unequal rights; it lies in
the assertion of "equal" rights.... What is _bad_? But I have already
answered: all that proceeds from weakness, from envy, from
_revenge_.--The anarchist and the Christian have the same ancestry....

[30] Few men are noble.


58.

In point of fact, the end for which one lies makes a great difference:
whether one preserves thereby or destroys. There is a perfect likeness
between Christian and anarchist: their object, their instinct, points
only toward destruction. One need only turn to history for a proof of
this: there it appears with appalling distinctness. We have just studied
a code of religious legislation whose object it was to convert the
conditions which cause life to _flourish_ into an "eternal" social
organization,--Christianity found its mission in putting an end to such
an organization, _because life flourished under it_. There the benefits
that reason had produced during long ages of experiment and insecurity
were applied to the most remote uses, and an effort was made to bring in
a harvest that should be as large, as rich and as complete as possible;
here, on the contrary, the harvest is _blighted_ overnight.... That
which stood there _aere perennis_, the _imperium Romanum_, the most
magnificent form of organization under difficult conditions that has
ever been achieved, and compared to which everything before it and after
it appears as patchwork, bungling, _dilletantism_--those holy anarchists
made it a matter of "piety" to destroy "the world," _which is to say_,
the _imperium Romanum_, so that in the end not a stone stood upon
another--and even Germans and other such louts were able to become its
masters.... The Christian and the anarchist: both are _décadents_; both
are incapable of any act that is not disintegrating, poisonous,
degenerating, _blood-sucking_; both have an instinct of _mortal hatred_
of everything that stands up, and is great, and has durability, and
promises life a future.... Christianity was the vampire of the _imperium
Romanum_,--overnight it destroyed the vast achievement of the Romans:
the conquest of the soil for a great culture _that could await its
time_. Can it be that this fact is not yet understood? The _imperium
Romanum_ that we know, and that the history of the Roman provinces
teaches us to know better and better,--this most admirable of all works
of art in the grand manner was merely the beginning, and the structure
to follow was not to _prove_ its worth for thousands of years. To this
day, nothing on a like scale _sub specie aeterni_ has been brought into
being, or even dreamed of!--This organization was strong enough to
withstand bad emperors: the accident of personality has nothing to do
with such things--the _first_ principle of all genuinely great
architecture. But it was not strong enough to stand up against the
_corruptest_ of all forms of corruption--against Christians.... These
stealthy worms, which under the cover of night, mist and duplicity,
crept upon every individual, sucking him dry of all earnest interest in
_real_ things, of all instinct for _reality_--this cowardly, effeminate
and sugar-coated gang gradually alienated all "souls," step by step,
from that colossal edifice, turning against it all the meritorious,
manly and noble natures that had found in the cause of Rome their own
cause, their own serious purpose, their own _pride_. The sneakishness of
hypocrisy, the secrecy of the conventicle, concepts as black as hell,
such as the sacrifice of the innocent, the _unio mystica_ in the
drinking of blood, above all, the slowly rekindled fire of revenge, of
Chandala revenge--all _that_ sort of thing became master of Rome: the
same kind of religion which, in a pre-existent form, Epicurus had
combatted. One has but to read Lucretius to know _what_ Epicurus made
war upon--_not_ paganism, but "Christianity," which is to say, the
corruption of souls by means of the concepts of guilt, punishment and
immortality.--He combatted the _subterranean_ cults, the whole of latent
Christianity--to deny immortality was already a form of genuine
_salvation_.--Epicurus had triumphed, and every respectable intellect in
Rome was Epicurean--_when Paul appeared_ ... Paul, the Chandala hatred
of Rome, of "the world," in the flesh and inspired by genius--the Jew,
the _eternal_ Jew _par excellence_.... What he saw was how, with the aid
of the small sectarian Christian movement that stood apart from Judaism,
a "world conflagration" might be kindled; how, with the symbol of "God
on the cross," all secret seditions, all the fruits of anarchistic
intrigues in the empire, might be amalgamated into one immense power.
"Salvation is of the Jews."--Christianity is the formula for exceeding
_and_ summing up the subterranean cults of all varieties, that of
Osiris, that of the Great Mother, that of Mithras, for instance: in his
discernment of this fact the genius of Paul showed itself. His instinct
was here so sure that, with reckless violence to the truth, he put the
ideas which lent fascination to every sort of Chandala religion into the
mouth of the "Saviour" as his own inventions, and not only into the
mouth--he _made_ out of him something that even a priest of Mithras
could understand.... This was his revelation at Damascus: he grasped the
fact that he _needed_ the belief in immortality in order to rob "the
world" of its value, that the concept of "hell" would master Rome--that
the notion of a "beyond" is the _death of life_.... Nihilist and
Christian: they rhyme in German, and they do more than rhyme....


59.

The whole labour of the ancient world gone for _naught_: I have no word
to describe the feelings that such an enormity arouses in me.--And,
considering the fact that its labour was merely preparatory, that with
adamantine self-consciousness it laid only the foundations for a work to
go on for thousands of years, the whole _meaning_ of antiquity
disappears!... To what end the Greeks? to what end the Romans?--All the
prerequisites to a learned culture, all the _methods_ of science, were
already there; man had already perfected the great and incomparable art
of reading profitably--that first necessity to the tradition of
culture, the unity of the sciences; the natural sciences, in alliance
with mathematics and mechanics, were on the right road,--_the sense of
fact_, the last and more valuable of all the senses, had its schools,
and its traditions were already centuries old! Is all this properly
understood? Every _essential_ to the beginning of the work was
ready:--and the _most_ essential, it cannot be said too often, are
methods, and also the most difficult to develop, and the longest opposed
by habit and laziness. What we have today reconquered, with unspeakable
self-discipline, for ourselves--for certain bad instincts, certain
Christian instincts, still lurk in our bodies--that is to say, the keen
eye for reality, the cautious hand, patience and seriousness in the
smallest things, the whole _integrity_ of knowledge--all these things
were already there, and had been there for two thousand years! _More_,
there was also a refined and excellent tact and taste! _Not_ as mere
brain-drilling! _Not_ as "German" culture, with its loutish manners! But
as body, as bearing, as instinct--in short, as reality.... _All gone for
naught!_ Overnight it became merely a memory!--The Greeks! The Romans!
Instinctive nobility, taste, methodical inquiry, genius for organization
and administration, faith in and the _will_ to secure the future of man,
a great yes to everything entering into the _imperium Romanum_ and
palpable to all the senses, a grand style that was beyond mere art, but
had become reality, truth, _life_....--All overwhelmed in a night, but
not by a convulsion of nature! Not trampled to death by Teutons and
others of heavy hoof! But brought to shame by crafty, sneaking,
invisible, anæmic vampires! Not conquered,--only sucked dry!... Hidden
vengefulness, petty envy, became _master_! Everything wretched,
intrinsically ailing, and invaded by bad feelings, the whole
_ghetto-world_ of the soul, was at once _on top_!--One needs but read
any of the Christian agitators, for example, St. Augustine, in order to
realize, in order to smell, what filthy fellows came to the top. It
would be an error, however, to assume that there was any lack of
understanding in the leaders of the Christian movement:--ah, but they
were clever, clever to the point of holiness, these fathers of the
church! What they lacked was something quite different. Nature
neglected--perhaps forgot--to give them even the most modest endowment
of respectable, of upright, of _cleanly_ instincts.... Between
ourselves, they are not even men.... If Islam despises Christianity, it
has a thousandfold right to do so: Islam at least assumes that it is
dealing with _men_....


60.

Christianity destroyed for us the whole harvest of ancient civilization,
and later it also destroyed for us the whole harvest of _Mohammedan_
civilization. The wonderful culture of the Moors in Spain, which was
fundamentally nearer to _us_ and appealed more to our senses and tastes
than that of Rome and Greece, was _trampled down_ (--I do not say by
what sort of feet--) Why? Because it had to thank noble and manly
instincts for its origin--because it said yes to life, even to the rare
and refined luxuriousness of Moorish life!... The crusaders later made
war on something before which it would have been more fitting for them
to have grovelled in the dust--a civilization beside which even that of
our nineteenth century seems very poor and very "senile."--What they
wanted, of course, was booty: the orient was rich.... Let us put aside
our prejudices! The crusades were a higher form of piracy, nothing more!
The German nobility, which is fundamentally a Viking nobility, was in
its element there: the church knew only too well how the German nobility
was to be _won_.... The German noble, always the "Swiss guard" of the
church, always in the service of every bad instinct of the church--_but
well paid_.... Consider the fact that it is precisely the aid of German
swords and German blood and valour that has enabled the church to carry
through its war to the death upon everything noble on earth! At this
point a host of painful questions suggest themselves. The German
nobility stands _outside_ the history of the higher civilization: the
reason is obvious.... Christianity, alcohol--the two _great_ means of
corruption.... Intrinsically there should be no more choice between
Islam and Christianity than there is between an Arab and a Jew. The
decision is already reached; nobody remains at liberty to choose here.
Either a man is a Chandala or he is not.... "War to the knife with Rome!
Peace and friendship with Islam!": this was the feeling, this was the
_act_, of that great free spirit, that genius among German emperors,
Frederick II. What! must a German first be a genius, a free spirit,
before he can feel _decently_? I can't make out how a German could ever
feel _Christian_....


61.

Here it becomes necessary to call up a memory that must be a hundred
times more painful to Germans. The Germans have destroyed for Europe the
last great harvest of civilization that Europe was ever to reap--the
_Renaissance_. Is it understood at last, _will_ it ever be understood,
_what_ the Renaissance was? _The transvaluation of Christian
values_,--an attempt with all available means, all instincts and all the
resources of genius to bring about a triumph of the _opposite_ values,
the more _noble_ values.... This has been the one great war of the past;
there has never been a more critical question than that of the
Renaissance--it is _my_ question too--; there has never been a form of
_attack_ more fundamental, more direct, or more violently delivered by a
whole front upon the center of the enemy! To attack at the critical
place, at the very seat of Christianity, and there enthrone the more
noble values--that is to say, to _insinuate_ them into the instincts,
into the most fundamental needs and appetites of those sitting there ...
I see before me the _possibility_ of a perfectly heavenly enchantment
and spectacle:--it seems to me to scintillate with all the vibrations of
a fine and delicate beauty, and within it there is an art so divine, so
infernally divine, that one might search in vain for thousands of years
for another such possibility; I see a spectacle so rich in significance
and at the same time so wonderfully full of paradox that it should
arouse all the gods on Olympus to immortal laughter--_Cæsar Borgia as
pope!_... Am I understood?... Well then, _that_ would have been the
sort of triumph that _I_ alone am longing for today--: by it
Christianity would have been _swept away_!--What happened? A German
monk, Luther, came to Rome. This monk, with all the vengeful instincts
of an unsuccessful priest in him, raised a rebellion _against_ the
Renaissance in Rome.... Instead of grasping, with profound thanksgiving,
the miracle that had taken place: the conquest of Christianity at its
_capital_--instead of this, his hatred was stimulated by the spectacle.
A religious man thinks only of himself.--Luther saw only the _depravity_
of the papacy at the very moment when the opposite was becoming
apparent: the old corruption, the _peccatum originale_, Christianity
itself, no longer occupied the papal chair! Instead there was life!
Instead there was the triumph of life! Instead there was a great yea to
all lofty, beautiful and daring things!... And Luther _restored the
church_: he attacked it.... The Renaissance--an event without meaning, a
great futility!--Ah, these Germans, what they have not cost us!
_Futility_--that has always been the work of the Germans.--The
Reformation; Leibnitz; Kant and so-called German philosophy; the war
of "liberation"; the empire--every time a futile substitute for
something that once existed, for something _irrecoverable_.... These
Germans, I confess, are my enemies: I despise all their uncleanliness
in concept and valuation, their cowardice before every honest yea
and nay. For nearly a thousand years they have tangled and confused
everything their fingers have touched; they have on their conscience
all the half-way measures, all the three-eighths-way measures, that
Europe is sick of,--they also have on their conscience the uncleanest
variety of Christianity that exists, and the most incurable and
indestructible--Protestantism.... If mankind never manages to get rid
of Christianity the _Germans_ will be to blame....


62.

--With this I come to a conclusion and pronounce my judgment. I
_condemn_ Christianity; I bring against the Christian church the most
terrible of all the accusations that an accuser has ever had in his
mouth. It is, to me, the greatest of all imaginable corruptions; it
seeks to work the ultimate corruption, the worst possible corruption.
The Christian church has left nothing untouched by its depravity; it has
turned every value into worthlessness, and every truth into a lie, and
every integrity into baseness of soul. Let any one dare to speak to me
of its "humanitarian" blessings! Its deepest necessities range it
against any effort to abolish distress; it lives by distress; it
_creates_ distress to make _itself_ immortal.... For example, the worm
of sin: it was the church that first enriched mankind with this
misery!--The "equality of souls before God"--this fraud, this _pretext_
for the _rancunes_ of all the base-minded--this explosive concept,
ending in revolution, the modern idea, and the notion of overthrowing
the whole social order--this is _Christian_ dynamite.... The
"humanitarian" blessings of Christianity forsooth! To breed out of
_humanitas_ a self-contradiction, an art of self-pollution, a will to
lie at any price, an aversion and contempt for all good and honest
instincts! All this, to me, is the "humanitarianism" of
Christianity!--Parasitism as the _only_ practice of the church; with its
anæmic and "holy" ideals, sucking all the blood, all the love, all the
hope out of life; the beyond as the will to deny all reality; the cross
as the distinguishing mark of the most subterranean conspiracy ever
heard of,--against health, beauty, well-being, intellect, _kindness_ of
soul--_against life itself_....

This eternal accusation against Christianity I shall write upon all
walls, wherever walls are to be found--I have letters that even the
blind will be able to see.... I call Christianity the one great curse,
the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge,
for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and
_small_ enough,--I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human
race....

And mankind reckons _time_ from the _dies nefastus_ when this fatality
befell--from the _first_ day of Christianity!--_Why not rather from its
last?_--_From today?_--The transvaluation of all values!...AN ATTEMPT AT SELF-CRITICISM.

I.


Whatever may lie at the bottom of this doubtful book must be a
question of the first rank and attractiveness, moreover a deeply
personal question,--in proof thereof observe the time in which it
originated, _in spite_ of which it originated, the exciting period
of the Franco-German war of 1870-71. While the thunder of the battle
of Wörth rolled over Europe, the ruminator and riddle-lover, who had
to be the parent of this book, sat somewhere in a nook of the Alps,
lost in riddles and ruminations, consequently very much concerned and
unconcerned at the same time, and wrote down his meditations on the
_Greeks,_--the kernel of the curious and almost inaccessible book, to
which this belated prologue (or epilogue) is to be devoted. A few weeks
later: and he found himself under the walls of Metz, still wrestling
with the notes of interrogation he had set down concerning the alleged
"cheerfulness" of the Greeks and of Greek art; till at last, in that
month of deep suspense, when peace was debated at Versailles, he too
attained to peace with himself, and, slowly recovering from a disease
brought home from the field, made up his mind definitely regarding the
"Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of _Music."_--From music? Music and
Tragedy? Greeks and tragic music? Greeks and the Art-work of pessimism?
A race of men, well-fashioned, beautiful, envied, life-inspiring, like
no other race hitherto, the Greeks--indeed? The Greeks were _in need_
of tragedy? Yea--of art? Wherefore--Greek art?...

We can thus guess where the great note of interrogation concerning the
value of existence had been set. Is pessimism _necessarily_ the sign of
decline, of decay, of failure, of exhausted and weakened instincts?--as
was the case with the Indians, as is, to all appearance, the case with
us "modern" men and Europeans? Is there a pessimism of _strength_? An
intellectual predilection for what is hard, awful, evil, problematical
in existence, owing to well-being, to exuberant health, to _fullness_
of existence? Is there perhaps suffering in overfullness itself? A
seductive fortitude with the keenest of glances, which _yearns_ for
the terrible, as for the enemy, the worthy enemy, with whom it may try
its strength? from whom it is willing to learn what "fear" is? What
means _tragic_ myth to the Greeks of the best, strongest, bravest era?
And the prodigious phenomenon of the Dionysian? And that which was
born thereof, tragedy?--And again: that of which tragedy died, the
Socratism of morality, the dialectics, contentedness and cheerfulness
of the theoretical man--indeed? might not this very Socratism
be a sign of decline, of weariness, of disease, of anarchically
disintegrating instincts? And the "Hellenic cheerfulness" of the later
Hellenism merely a glowing sunset? The Epicurean will _counter_ to
pessimism merely a precaution of the sufferer? And science itself,
our science--ay, viewed as a symptom of life, what really signifies
all science? Whither, worse still, _whence_--all science? Well? Is
scientism perhaps only fear and evasion of pessimism? A subtle defence
against--_truth!_ Morally speaking, something like falsehood and
cowardice? And, unmorally speaking, an artifice? O Socrates, Socrates,
was this perhaps _thy_ secret? Oh mysterious ironist, was this perhaps
thine--irony?...

What I then laid hands on, something terrible and dangerous, a
problem with horns, not necessarily a bull itself, but at all events
a _new_ problem: I should say to-day it was the _problem of science_
itself--science conceived for the first time as problematic, as
questionable. But the book, in which my youthful ardour and suspicion
then discharged themselves--what an _impossible_ book must needs
grow out of a task so disagreeable to youth. Constructed of nought
but precocious, unripened self-experiences, all of which lay close
to the threshold of the communicable, based on the groundwork of
_art_--for the problem of science cannot be discerned on the groundwork
of science,--a book perhaps for artists, with collateral analytical
and retrospective aptitudes (that is, an exceptional kind of artists,
for whom one must seek and does not even care to seek ...), full of
psychological innovations and artists' secrets, with an artists'
metaphysics in the background, a work of youth, full of youth's mettle
and youth's melancholy, independent, defiantly self-sufficient even
when it seems to bow to some authority and self-veneration; in short,
a firstling-work, even in every bad sense of the term; in spite of its
senile problem, affected with every fault of youth, above all with
youth's prolixity and youth's "storm and stress": on the other hand,
in view of the success it had (especially with the great artist to
whom it addressed itself, as it were, in a duologue, Richard Wagner) a
_demonstrated_ book, I mean a book which, at any rate, sufficed "for
the best of its time." On this account, if for no other reason, it
should be treated with some consideration and reserve; yet I shall not
altogether conceal how disagreeable it now appears to me, how after
sixteen years it stands a total stranger before me,--before an eye
which is more mature, and a hundred times more fastidious, but which
has by no means grown colder nor lost any of its interest in that
self-same task essayed for the first time by this daring book,--_to
view science through the optics of the artist, and art moreover through
the optics of life...._



3.


I say again, to-day it is an impossible book to me,--I call it badly
written, heavy, painful, image-angling and image-entangling, maudlin,
sugared at times even to femininism, uneven in tempo, void of the will
to logical cleanliness, very convinced and therefore rising above the
necessity of demonstration, distrustful even of the _propriety_ of
demonstration, as being a book for initiates, as "music" for those who
are baptised with the name of Music, who are united from the beginning
of things by common ties of rare experiences in art, as a countersign
for blood-relations _in artibus._--a haughty and fantastic book,
which from the very first withdraws even more from the _profanum
vulgus_ of the "cultured" than from the "people," but which also, as
its effect has shown and still shows, knows very well how to seek
fellow-enthusiasts and lure them to new by-ways and dancing-grounds.
Here, at any rate--thus much was acknowledged with curiosity as well
as with aversion--a _strange_ voice spoke, the disciple of a still
"unknown God," who for the time being had hidden himself under the
hood of the scholar, under the German's gravity and disinclination for
dialectics, even under the bad manners of the Wagnerian; here was a
spirit with strange and still nameless needs, a memory bristling with
questions, experiences and obscurities, beside which stood the name
Dionysos like one more note of interrogation; here spoke--people said
to themselves with misgivings--something like a mystic and almost
mænadic soul, which, undecided whether it should disclose or conceal
itself, stammers with an effort and capriciously as in a strange
tongue. It should have _sung,_ this "new soul"--and not spoken! What
a pity, that I did not dare to say what I then had to say, as a poet:
I could have done so perhaps! Or at least as a philologist:--for even
at the present day well-nigh everything in this domain remains to be
discovered and disinterred by the philologist! Above all the problem,
_that_ here there _is_ a problem before us,--and that, so long as we
have no answer to the question "what is Dionysian?" the Greeks are now
as ever wholly unknown and inconceivable....



4.


Ay, what is Dionysian?--In this book may be found an answer,--a
"knowing one" speaks here, the votary and disciple of his god.
Perhaps I should now speak more guardedly and less eloquently of a
psychological question so difficult as the origin of tragedy among the
Greeks. A fundamental question is the relation of the Greek to pain,
his degree of sensibility,--did this relation remain constant? or did
it veer about?--the question, whether his ever-increasing _longing
for beauty,_ for festivals, gaieties, new cults, did really grow out
of want, privation, melancholy, pain? For suppose even this to be
true--and Pericles (or Thucydides) intimates as much in the great
Funeral Speech:--whence then the opposite longing, which appeared
first in the order of time, the _longing for the ugly_, the good,
resolute desire of the Old Hellene for pessimism, for tragic myth, for
the picture of all that is terrible, evil, enigmatical, destructive,
fatal at the basis of existence,--whence then must tragedy have
sprung? Perhaps from _joy,_ from strength, from exuberant health, from
over-fullness. And what then, physiologically speaking, is the meaning
of that madness, out of which comic as well as tragic art has grown,
the Dionysian madness? What? perhaps madness is not necessarily the
symptom of degeneration, of decline, of belated culture? Perhaps there
are--a question for alienists--neuroses of _health_? of folk-youth
and youthfulness? What does that synthesis of god and goat in the
Satyr point to? What self-experience what "stress," made the Greek
think of the Dionysian reveller and primitive man as a satyr? And as
regards the origin of the tragic chorus: perhaps there were endemic
ecstasies in the eras when the Greek body bloomed and the Greek soul
brimmed over with life? Visions and hallucinations, which took hold
of entire communities, entire cult-assemblies? What if the Greeks
in the very wealth of their youth had the will _to be_ tragic and
were pessimists? What if it was madness itself, to use a word of
Plato's, which brought the _greatest_ blessings upon Hellas? And
what if, on the other hand and conversely, at the very time of their
dissolution and weakness, the Greeks became always more optimistic,
more superficial, more histrionic, also more ardent for logic and
the logicising of the world,--consequently at the same time more
"cheerful" and more "scientific"? Ay, despite all "modern ideas" and
prejudices of the democratic taste, may not the triumph of _optimism,_
the _common sense_ that has gained the upper hand, the practical and
theoretical _utilitarianism,_ like democracy itself, with which it is
synchronous--be symptomatic of declining vigour, of approaching age,
of physiological weariness? And _not_ at all--pessimism? Was Epicurus
an optimist--because a _sufferer_?... We see it is a whole bundle of
weighty questions which this book has taken upon itself,--let us not
fail to add its weightiest question! Viewed through the optics of
_life,_ what is the meaning of--morality?...



5.


Already in the foreword to Richard Wagner, art---and _not_ morality--is
set down as the properly _metaphysical_ activity of man; in the
book itself the piquant proposition recurs time and again, that the
existence of the world is _justified_ only as an æsthetic phenomenon.
Indeed, the entire book recognises only an artist-thought and
artist-after-thought behind all occurrences,--a "God," if you will,
but certainly only an altogether thoughtless and unmoral artist-God,
who, in construction as in destruction, in good as in evil, desires
to become conscious of his own equable joy and sovereign glory; who,
in creating worlds, frees himself from the _anguish_ of fullness
and _overfullness,_ from the _suffering_ of the contradictions
concentrated within him. The world, that is, the redemption of God
_attained_ at every moment, as the perpetually changing, perpetually
new vision of the most suffering, most antithetical, most contradictory
being, who contrives to redeem himself only in _appearance:_ this
entire artist-metaphysics, call it arbitrary, idle, fantastic, if
you will,--the point is, that it already betrays a spirit, which is
determined some day, at all hazards, to make a stand against the
_moral_ interpretation and significance of life. Here, perhaps for the
first time, a pessimism "Beyond Good and Evil" announces itself, here
that "perverseness of disposition" obtains expression and formulation,
against which Schopenhauer never grew tired of hurling beforehand his
angriest imprecations and thunderbolts,--a philosophy which dares to
put, derogatorily put, morality itself in the world of phenomena, and
not only among "phenomena" (in the sense of the idealistic _terminus
technicus_), but among the "illusions," as appearance, semblance,
error, interpretation, accommodation, art. Perhaps the depth of this
_antimoral_ tendency may be best estimated from the guarded and
hostile silence with which Christianity is treated throughout this
book,--Christianity, as being the most extravagant burlesque of the
moral theme to which mankind has hitherto been obliged to listen. In
fact, to the purely æsthetic world-interpretation and justification
taught in this book, there is no greater antithesis than the Christian
dogma, which is _only_ and will be only moral, and which, with
its absolute standards, for instance, its truthfulness of God,
relegates--that is, disowns, convicts, condemns--art, _all_ art, to
the realm of _falsehood._ Behind such a mode of thought and valuation,
which, if at all genuine, must be hostile to art, I always experienced
what was _hostile to life,_ the wrathful, vindictive counterwill to
life itself: for all life rests on appearance, art, illusion, optics,
necessity of perspective and error. From the very first Christianity
was, essentially and thoroughly, the nausea and surfeit of Life for
Life, which only disguised, concealed and decked itself out under the
belief in "another" or "better" life. The hatred of the "world," the
curse on the affections, the fear of beauty and sensuality, another
world, invented for the purpose of slandering this world the more,
at bottom a longing for. Nothingness, for the end, for rest, for the
"Sabbath of Sabbaths"--all this, as also the unconditional will of
Christianity to recognise _only_ moral values, has always appeared to
me as the most dangerous and ominous of all possible forms of a "will
to perish"; at the least, as the symptom of a most fatal disease, of
profoundest weariness, despondency, exhaustion, impoverishment of
life,--for before the tribunal of morality (especially Christian, that
is, unconditional morality) life _must_ constantly and inevitably be
the loser, because life _is_ something essentially unmoral,--indeed,
oppressed with the weight of contempt and the everlasting No, life
_must_ finally be regarded as unworthy of desire, as in itself
unworthy. Morality itself what?--may not morality be a "will to
disown life," a secret instinct for annihilation, a principle of
decay, of depreciation, of slander, a beginning of the end? And,
consequently, the danger of dangers?... It was _against_ morality,
therefore, that my instinct, as an intercessory-instinct for life,
turned in this questionable book, inventing for itself a fundamental
counter--dogma and counter-valuation of life, purely artistic, purely
_anti-Christian._ What should I call it? As a philologist and man of
words I baptised it, not without some liberty--for who could be sure
of the proper name of the Antichrist?--with the name of a Greek god: I
called it _Dionysian._



6.


You see which problem I ventured to touch upon in this early work?...
How I now regret, that I had not then the courage (or immodesty?) to
allow myself, in all respects, the use of an _individual language_
for such _individual_ contemplations and ventures in the field of
thought--that I laboured to express, in Kantian and Schopenhauerian
formulæ, strange and new valuations, which ran fundamentally counter
to the spirit of Kant and Schopenhauer, as well as to their taste!
What, forsooth, were Schopenhauer's views on tragedy? "What gives"--he
says in _Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,_ II. 495--"to all tragedy
that singular swing towards elevation, is the awakening of the
knowledge that the world, that life, cannot satisfy us thoroughly,
and consequently is _not worthy_ of our attachment In this consists
the tragic spirit: it therefore leads to _resignation_." Oh, how
differently Dionysos spoke to me! Oh how far from me then was just
this entire resignationism!--But there is something far worse in this
book, which I now regret even more than having obscured and spoiled
Dionysian anticipations with Schopenhauerian formulæ: to wit, that, in
general, I _spoiled_ the grand _Hellenic problem,_ as it had opened
up before me, by the admixture of the most modern things! That I
entertained hopes, where nothing was to be hoped for, where everything
pointed all-too-clearly to an approaching end! That, on the basis of
our latter-day German music, I began to fable about the "spirit of
Teutonism," as if it were on the point of discovering and returning
to itself,--ay, at the very time that the German spirit which not so
very long before had had the will to the lordship over Europe, the
strength to lead and govern Europe, testamentarily and conclusively
_resigned_ and, under the pompous pretence of empire-founding,
effected its transition to mediocritisation, democracy, and "modern
ideas." In very fact, I have since learned to regard this "spirit of
Teutonism" as something to be despaired of and unsparingly treated,
as also our present _German music,_ which is Romanticism through and
through and the most un-Grecian of all possible forms of art: and
moreover a first-rate nerve-destroyer, doubly dangerous for a people
given to drinking and revering the unclear as a virtue, namely, in
its twofold capacity of an intoxicating and stupefying narcotic. Of
course, apart from all precipitate hopes and faulty applications to
matters specially modern, with which I then spoiled my first book, the
great Dionysian note of interrogation, as set down therein, continues
standing on and on, even with reference to music: how must we conceive
of a music, which is no longer of Romantic origin, like the German; but
of _Dionysian_?...



7.


--But, my dear Sir, if _your_ book is not Romanticism, what in
the world is? Can the deep hatred of the present, of "reality"
and "modern ideas" be pushed farther than has been done in your
artist-metaphysics?--which would rather believe in Nothing, or in
the devil, than in the "Now"? Does not a radical bass of wrath and
annihilative pleasure growl on beneath all your contrapuntal vocal
art and aural seduction, a mad determination to oppose all that "now"
is, a will which is not so very far removed from practical nihilism
and which seems to say: "rather let nothing be true, than that _you_
should be in the right, than that _your_ truth should prevail!"
Hear, yourself, my dear Sir Pessimist and art-deifier, with ever
so unlocked ears, a single select passage of your own book, that
not ineloquent dragon-slayer passage, which may sound insidiously
rat-charming to young ears and hearts. What? is not that the true
blue romanticist-confession of 1830 under the mask of the pessimism
of 1850? After which, of course, the usual romanticist finale at once
strikes up,--rupture, collapse, return and prostration before an old
belief, before _the_ old God.... What? is not your pessimist book
itself a piece of anti-Hellenism and Romanticism, something "equally
intoxicating and befogging," a narcotic at all events, ay, a piece of
music, of _German_ music? But listen:

    Let us imagine a rising generation with this undauntedness
    of vision, with this heroic impulse towards the prodigious,
    let us imagine the bold step of these dragon-slayers,
    the proud daring with which they turn their backs on all
    the effeminate doctrines of optimism, in order "to live
    resolutely" in the Whole and in the Full: _would it not be
    necessary_ for the tragic man of this culture, with his
    self-discipline to earnestness and terror, to desire a new
    art, _the art of metaphysical comfort,_ tragedy as the
    Helena belonging to him, and that he should exclaim with
    Faust:

        "Und sollt ich nicht, sehnsüchtigster Gewalt,
        In's Leben ziehn die einzigste Gestalt?"[1]


"Would it not be _necessary_?" ... No, thrice no! ye young
romanticists: it would _not_ be necessary! But it is very probable,
that things may _end_ thus, that _ye_ may end thus, namely "comforted,"
as it is written, in spite of all self-discipline to earnestness and
terror; metaphysically comforted, in short, as Romanticists are wont to
end, as _Christians...._ No! ye should first of all learn the art of
earthly comfort, ye should learn to _laugh,_ my young friends, if ye
are at all determined to remain pessimists: if so, you will perhaps,
as laughing ones, eventually send all metaphysical comfortism to the
devil--and metaphysics first of all! Or, to say it in the language of
that Dionysian ogre, called _Zarathustra_:

    "Lift up your hearts, my brethren, high, higher! And do
    not forget your legs! Lift up also your legs, ye good
    dancers--and better still if ye stand also on your heads!

    "This crown of the laughter, this rose-garland crown--I
    myself have put on this crown; I myself have consecrated my
    laughter. No one else have I found to-day strong enough for
    this.

    "Zarathustra the dancer, Zarathustra the light one,
    who beckoneth with his pinions, one ready for flight,
    beckoning unto all birds, ready and prepared, a blissfully
    light-spirited one:--

    "Zarathustra the soothsayer, Zarathustra the sooth-laugher,
    no impatient one, no absolute one, one who loveth leaps and
    side-leaps: I myself have put on this crown!

    "This crown of the laughter, this rose-garland crown--to
    you my brethren do I cast this crown! Laughing have I
    consecrated: ye higher men, _learn,_ I pray you--to laugh!"

    _Thus spake Zarathustra_, lxxiii. 17, 18, and 20.

THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY

FROM THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC




FOREWORD TO RICHARD WAGNER.


In order to keep at a distance all the possible scruples, excitements,
and misunderstandings to which the thoughts gathered in this essay
will give occasion, considering the peculiar character of our æsthetic
publicity, and to be able also Co write the introductory remarks
with the same contemplative delight, the impress of which, as the
petrifaction of good and elevating hours, it bears on every page, I
form a conception of the moment when you, my highly honoured friend,
will receive this essay; how you, say after an evening walk in the
winter snow, will behold the unbound Prometheus on the title-page,
read my name, and be forthwith convinced that, whatever this essay may
contain, the author has something earnest and impressive to say, and,
moreover, that in all his meditations he communed with you as with one
present and could thus write only what befitted your presence. You
will thus remember that it was at the same time as your magnificent
dissertation on Beethoven originated, viz., amidst the horrors and
sublimities of the war which had just then broken out, that I collected
myself for these thoughts. But those persons would err, to whom this
collection suggests no more perhaps than the antithesis of patriotic
excitement and æsthetic revelry, of gallant earnestness and sportive
delight. Upon a real perusal of this essay, such readers will, rather
to their surprise, discover how earnest is the German problem we have
to deal with, which we properly place, as a vortex and turning-point,
in the very midst of German hopes. Perhaps, however, this same class
of readers will be shocked at seeing an æsthetic problem taken so
seriously, especially if they can recognise in art no more than a merry
diversion, a readily dispensable court-jester to the "earnestness
of existence": as if no one were aware of the real meaning of this
confrontation with the "earnestness of existence." These earnest ones
may be informed that I am convinced that art is the highest task and
the properly metaphysical activity of this life, as it is understood by
the man, to whom, as my sublime protagonist on this path, I would now
dedicate this essay.

BASEL, _end of the year_ 1871.




THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY.



1.


We shall have gained much for the science of æsthetics, when once we
have perceived not only by logical inference, but by the immediate
certainty of intuition, that the continuous development of art is bound
up with the duplexity of the _Apollonian_ and the _Dionysian:_ in
like manner as procreation is dependent on the duality of the sexes,
involving perpetual conflicts with only periodically intervening
reconciliations. These names we borrow from the Greeks, who disclose
to the intelligent observer the profound mysteries of their view of
art, not indeed in concepts, but in the impressively clear figures of
their world of deities. It is in connection with Apollo and Dionysus,
the two art-deities of the Greeks, that we learn that there existed in
the Grecian world a wide antithesis, in origin and aims, between the
art of the shaper, the Apollonian, and the non-plastic art of music,
that of Dionysus: both these so heterogeneous tendencies run parallel
to each other, for the most part openly at variance, and continually
inciting each other to new and more powerful births, to perpetuate in
them the strife of this antithesis, which is but seemingly bridged over
by their mutual term "Art"; till at last, by a metaphysical miracle
of the Hellenic will, they appear paired with each other, and through
this pairing eventually generate the equally Dionysian and Apollonian
art-work of Attic tragedy.

In order to bring these two tendencies within closer range, let us
conceive them first of all as the separate art-worlds of _dreamland_
and _drunkenness;_ between which physiological phenomena a contrast
may be observed analogous to that existing between the Apollonian and
the Dionysian. In dreams, according to the conception of Lucretius,
the glorious divine figures first appeared to the souls of men, in
dreams the great shaper beheld the charming corporeal structure of
superhuman beings, and the Hellenic poet, if consulted on the mysteries
of poetic inspiration, would likewise have suggested dreams and would
have offered an explanation resembling that of Hans Sachs in the
Meistersingers:--

    Mein Freund, das grad' ist Dichters Werk,
    dass er sein Träumen deut' und merk'.
    Glaubt mir, des Menschen wahrster Wahn
    wird ihm im Traume aufgethan:
    all' Dichtkunst und Poeterei
    ist nichts als Wahrtraum-Deuterei.[1]


The beauteous appearance of the dream-worlds, in the production of
which every man is a perfect artist, is the presupposition of all
plastic art, and in fact, as we shall see, of an important half of
poetry also. We take delight in the immediate apprehension of form; all
forms speak to us; there is nothing indifferent, nothing superfluous.
But, together with the highest life of this dream-reality we also have,
glimmering through it, the sensation of its appearance: such at least
is my experience, as to the frequency, ay, normality of which I could
adduce many proofs, as also the sayings of the poets. Indeed, the man
of philosophic turn has a foreboding that underneath this reality in
which we live and have our being, another and altogether different
reality lies concealed, and that therefore it is also an appearance;
and Schopenhauer actually designates the gift of occasionally regarding
men and things as mere phantoms and dream-pictures as the criterion of
philosophical ability. Accordingly, the man susceptible to art stands
in the same relation to the reality of dreams as the philosopher to
the reality of existence; he is a close and willing observer, for from
these pictures he reads the meaning of life, and by these processes
he trains himself for life. And it is perhaps not only the agreeable
and friendly pictures that he realises in himself with such perfect
understanding: the earnest, the troubled, the dreary, the gloomy, the
sudden checks, the tricks of fortune, the uneasy presentiments, in
short, the whole "Divine Comedy" of life, and the Inferno, also pass
before him, not merely like pictures on the wall--for he too lives and
suffers in these scenes,--and yet not without that fleeting sensation
of appearance. And perhaps many a one will, like myself, recollect
having sometimes called out cheeringly and not without success amid the
dangers and terrors of dream-life: "It is a dream! I will dream on!" I
have likewise been told of persons capable of continuing the causality
of one and the same dream for three and even more successive nights:
all of which facts clearly testify that our innermost being, the common
substratum of all of us, experiences our dreams with deep joy and
cheerful acquiescence.

This cheerful acquiescence in the dream-experience has likewise been
embodied by the Greeks in their Apollo: for Apollo, as the god of
all shaping energies, is also the soothsaying god. He, who (as the
etymology of the name indicates) is the "shining one," the deity of
light, also rules over the fair appearance of the inner world of
fantasies. The higher truth, the perfection of these states in contrast
to the only partially intelligible everyday world, ay, the deep
consciousness of nature, healing and helping in sleep and dream, is at
the same time the symbolical analogue of the faculty of soothsaying
and, in general, of the arts, through which life is made possible and
worth living. But also that delicate line, which the dream-picture must
not overstep--lest it act pathologically (in which case appearance,
being reality pure and simple, would impose upon us)--must not be
wanting in the picture of Apollo: that measured limitation, that
freedom from the wilder emotions, that philosophical calmness of the
sculptor-god. His eye must be "sunlike," according to his origin; even
when it is angry and looks displeased, the sacredness of his beauteous
appearance is still there. And so we might apply to Apollo, in an
eccentric sense, what Schopenhauer says of the man wrapt in the veil
of Mâyâ[2]: _Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. p. 416: "Just as in
a stormy sea, unbounded in every direction, rising and falling with
howling mountainous waves, a sailor sits in a boat and trusts in his
frail barque: so in the midst of a world of sorrows the individual sits
quietly supported by and trusting in his _principium individuationis_."
Indeed, we might say of Apollo, that in him the unshaken faith in
this _principium_ and the quiet sitting of the man wrapt therein have
received their sublimest expression; and we might even designate Apollo
as the glorious divine image of the _principium individuationis,_
from out of the gestures and looks of which all the joy and wisdom of
"appearance," together with its beauty, speak to us.

In the same work Schopenhauer has described to us the stupendous _awe_
which seizes upon man, when of a sudden he is at a loss to account for
the cognitive forms of a phenomenon, in that the principle of reason,
in some one of its manifestations, seems to admit of an exception.
Add to this awe the blissful ecstasy which rises from the innermost
depths of man, ay, of nature, at this same collapse of the _principium
individuationis,_ and we shall gain an insight into the being of
the _Dionysian,_ which is brought within closest ken perhaps by the
analogy of _drunkenness._ It is either under the influence of the
narcotic draught, of which the hymns of all primitive men and peoples
tell us, or by the powerful approach of spring penetrating all nature
with joy, that those Dionysian emotions awake, in the augmentation of
which the subjective vanishes to complete self-forgetfulness. So also
in the German Middle Ages singing and dancing crowds, ever increasing
in number, were borne from place to place under this same Dionysian
power. In these St. John's and St. Vitus's dancers we again perceive
the Bacchic choruses of the Greeks, with their previous history in Asia
Minor, as far back as Babylon and the orgiastic Sacæa. There are some,
who, from lack of experience or obtuseness, will turn away from such
phenomena as "folk-diseases" with a smile of contempt or pity prompted
by the consciousness of their own health: of course, the poor wretches
do not divine what a cadaverous-looking and ghastly aspect this very
"health" of theirs presents when the glowing life of the Dionysian
revellers rushes past them.

Under the charm of the Dionysian not only is the covenant between man
and man again established, but also estranged, hostile or subjugated
nature again celebrates her reconciliation with her lost son, man. Of
her own accord earth proffers her gifts, and peacefully the beasts of
prey approach from the desert and the rocks. The chariot of Dionysus is
bedecked with flowers and garlands: panthers and tigers pass beneath
his yoke. Change Beethoven's "jubilee-song" into a painting, and, if
your imagination be equal to the occasion when the awestruck millions
sink into the dust, you will then be able to approach the Dionysian.
Now is the slave a free man, now all the stubborn, hostile barriers,
which necessity, caprice, or "shameless fashion" has set up between
man and man, are broken down. Now, at the evangel of cosmic harmony,
each one feels himself not only united, reconciled, blended with
his neighbour, but as one with him, as if the veil of Mâyâ has been
torn and were now merely fluttering in tatters before the mysterious
Primordial Unity. In song and in dance man exhibits himself as a member
of a higher community, has forgotten how to walk and speak, and is on
the point of taking a dancing flight into the air. His gestures bespeak
enchantment. Even as the animals now talk, and as the earth yields milk
and honey, so also something super-natural sounds forth from him: he
feels himself a god, he himself now walks about enchanted and elated
even as the gods whom he saw walking about in his dreams. Man is no
longer an artist, he has become a work of art: the artistic power of
all nature here reveals itself in the tremors of drunkenness to the
highest gratification of the Primordial Unity. The noblest clay, the
costliest marble, namely man, is here kneaded and cut, and the chisel
strokes of the Dionysian world-artist are accompanied with the cry of
the Eleusinian mysteries: "Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen? Ahnest du den
Schöpfer, Welt?"[3]

Thus far we have considered the Apollonian and his antithesis,
the Dionysian, as artistic powers, which burst forth from nature
herself, _without the mediation of the human artist,_ and in which
her art-impulses are satisfied in the most immediate and direct way:
first, as the pictorial world of dreams, the perfection of which
has no connection whatever with the intellectual height or artistic
culture of the unit man, and again, as drunken reality, which likewise
does not heed the unit man, but even seeks to destroy the individual
and redeem him by a mystic feeling of Oneness. Anent these immediate
art-states of nature every artist is either an "imitator," to wit,
either an Apollonian, an artist in dreams, or a Dionysian, an artist
in ecstasies, or finally--as for instance in Greek tragedy--an artist
in both dreams and ecstasies: so we may perhaps picture him, as in
his Dionysian drunkenness and mystical self-abnegation, lonesome and
apart from the revelling choruses, he sinks down, and how now, through
Apollonian dream-inspiration, his own state, _i.e._, his oneness
with the primal source of the universe, reveals itself to him _in a
symbolical dream-picture_.

After these general premisings and contrastings, let us now approach
the _Greeks_ in order to learn in what degree and to what height
these _art-impulses of nature_ were developed in them: whereby
we shall be enabled to understand and appreciate more deeply the
relation of the Greek artist to his archetypes, or, according to the
Aristotelian expression, "the imitation of nature." In spite of all the
dream-literature and the numerous dream-anecdotes of the Greeks, we can
speak only conjecturally, though with a fair degree of certainty, of
their _dreams._ Considering the incredibly precise and unerring plastic
power of their eyes, as also their manifest and sincere delight in
colours, we can hardly refrain (to the shame of every one born later)
from assuming for their very dreams a logical causality of lines and
contours, colours and groups, a sequence of scenes resembling their
best reliefs, the perfection of which would certainly justify us, if a
comparison were possible, in designating the dreaming Greeks as Homers
and Homer as a dreaming Greek: in a deeper sense than when modern man,
in respect to his dreams, ventures to compare himself with Shakespeare.

On the other hand, we should not have to speak conjecturally, if asked
to disclose the immense gap which separated the _Dionysian Greek_ from
the Dionysian barbarian. From all quarters of the Ancient World--to
say nothing of the modern--from Rome as far as Babylon, we can prove
the existence of Dionysian festivals, the type of which bears, at
best, the same relation to the Greek festivals as the bearded satyr,
who borrowed his name and attributes from the goat, does to Dionysus
himself. In nearly every instance the centre of these festivals lay
in extravagant sexual licentiousness, the waves of which overwhelmed
all family life and its venerable traditions; the very wildest beasts
of nature were let loose here, including that detestable mixture of
lust and cruelty which has always seemed to me the genuine "witches'
draught." For some time, however, it would seem that the Greeks
were perfectly secure and guarded against the feverish agitations
of these festivals (--the knowledge of which entered Greece by all
the channels of land and sea) by the figure of Apollo himself rising
here in full pride, who could not have held out the Gorgon's head to
a more dangerous power than this grotesquely uncouth Dionysian. It
is in Doric art that this majestically-rejecting attitude of Apollo
perpetuated itself. This opposition became more precarious and even
impossible, when, from out of the deepest root of the Hellenic nature,
similar impulses finally broke forth and made way for themselves:
the Delphic god, by a seasonably effected reconciliation, was now
contented with taking the destructive arms from the hands of his
powerful antagonist. This reconciliation marks the most important
moment in the history of the Greek cult: wherever we turn our eyes
we may observe the revolutions resulting from this event. It was
the reconciliation of two antagonists, with the sharp demarcation
of the boundary-lines to be thenceforth observed by each, and with
periodical transmission of testimonials;--in reality, the chasm was
not bridged over. But if we observe how, under the pressure of this
conclusion of peace, the Dionysian power manifested itself, we shall
now recognise in the Dionysian orgies of the Greeks, as compared with
the Babylonian Sacæa and their retrogression of man to the tiger and
the ape, the significance of festivals of world-redemption and days of
transfiguration. Not till then does nature attain her artistic jubilee;
not till then does the rupture of the _principium individuationis_
become an artistic phenomenon. That horrible "witches' draught" of
sensuality and cruelty was here powerless: only the curious blending
and duality in the emotions of the Dionysian revellers reminds one of
it--just as medicines remind one of deadly poisons,--that phenomenon,
to wit, that pains beget joy, that jubilation wrings painful sounds out
of the breast. From the highest joy sounds the cry of horror or the
yearning wail over an irretrievable loss. In these Greek festivals a
sentimental trait, as it were, breaks forth from nature, as if she must
sigh over her dismemberment into individuals. The song and pantomime
of such dually-minded revellers was something new and unheard-of in
the Homeric-Grecian world; and the Dionysian _music_ in particular
excited awe and horror. If music, as it would seem, was previously
known as an Apollonian art, it was, strictly speaking, only as the
wave-beat of rhythm, the formative power of which was developed to
the representation of Apollonian conditions. The music of Apollo was
Doric architectonics in tones, but in merely suggested tones, such
as those of the cithara. The very element which forms the essence of
Dionysian music (and hence of music in general) is carefully excluded
as un-Apollonian; namely, the thrilling power of the tone, the uniform
stream of the melos, and the thoroughly incomparable world of harmony.
In the Dionysian dithyramb man is incited to the highest exaltation
of all his symbolic faculties; something never before experienced
struggles for utterance--the annihilation of the veil of Mâyâ, Oneness
as genius of the race, ay, of nature. The essence of nature is now
to be expressed symbolically; a new world of symbols is required;
for once the entire symbolism of the body, not only the symbolism of
the lips, face, and speech, but the whole pantomime of dancing which
sets all the members into rhythmical motion. Thereupon the other
symbolic powers, those of music, in rhythmics, dynamics, and harmony,
suddenly become impetuous. To comprehend this collective discharge
of all the symbolic powers, a man must have already attained that
height of self-abnegation, which wills to express itself symbolically
through these powers: the Dithyrambic votary of Dionysus is therefore
understood only by those like himself! With what astonishment must the
Apollonian Greek have beheld him! With an astonishment, which was all
the greater the more it was mingled with the shuddering suspicion that
all this was in reality not so very foreign to him, yea, that, like
unto a veil, his Apollonian consciousness only hid this Dionysian world
from his view.



3.


In order to comprehend this, we must take down the artistic structure,
of the _Apollonian culture,_ as it were, stone by stone, till we behold
the foundations on which it rests. Here we observe first of all the
glorious _Olympian_ figures of the gods, standing on the gables of this
structure, whose deeds, represented in far-shining reliefs, adorn its
friezes. Though Apollo stands among them as an individual deity, side
by side with others, and without claim to priority of rank, we must not
suffer this fact to mislead us. The same impulse which embodied itself
in Apollo has, in general, given birth to this whole Olympian world,
and in this sense we may regard Apollo as the father thereof. What was
the enormous need from which proceeded such an illustrious group of
Olympian beings?

Whosoever, with another religion in his heart, approaches these
Olympians and seeks among them for moral elevation, even for sanctity,
for incorporeal spiritualisation, for sympathetic looks of love, will
soon be obliged to turn his back on them, discouraged and disappointed.
Here nothing suggests asceticism, spirituality, or duty: here only
an exuberant, even triumphant life speaks to us, in which everything
existing is deified, whether good or bad. And so the spectator will
perhaps stand quite bewildered before this fantastic exuberance of
life, and ask himself what magic potion these madly merry men could
have used for enjoying life, so that, wherever they turned their eyes,
Helena, the ideal image of their own existence "floating in sweet
sensuality," smiled upon them. But to this spectator, already turning
backwards, we must call out: "depart not hence, but hear rather what
Greek folk-wisdom says of this same life, which with such inexplicable
cheerfulness spreads out before thee." There is an ancient story that
king Midas hunted in the forest a long time for the wise _Silenus,_
the companion of Dionysus, without capturing him. When at last he fell
into his hands, the king asked what was best of all and most desirable
for man. Fixed and immovable, the demon remained silent; till at last,
forced by the king, he broke out with shrill laughter into these words:
"Oh, wretched race of a day, children of chance and misery, why do ye
compel me to say to you what it were most expedient for you not to
hear? What is best of all is for ever beyond your reach: not to be
born, not to _be_, to be _nothing._ The second best for you, however,
is soon to die."

How is the Olympian world of deities related to this folk-wisdom? Even
as the rapturous vision of the tortured martyr to his sufferings.

Now the Olympian magic mountain opens, as it were, to our view and
shows to us its roots. The Greek knew and felt the terrors and horrors
of existence: to be able to live at all, he had to interpose the
shining dream-birth of the Olympian world between himself and them.
The excessive distrust of the titanic powers of nature, the Moira
throning inexorably over all knowledge, the vulture of the great
philanthropist Prometheus, the terrible fate of the wise Œdipus, the
family curse of the Atridæ which drove Orestes to matricide; in short,
that entire philosophy of the sylvan god, with its mythical exemplars,
which wrought the ruin of the melancholy Etruscans--was again and again
surmounted anew by the Greeks through the artistic _middle world_ of
the Olympians, or at least veiled and withdrawn from sight. To be able
to live, the Greeks had, from direst necessity, to create these gods:
which process we may perhaps picture to ourselves in this manner: that
out of the original Titan thearchy of terror the Olympian thearchy of
joy was evolved, by slow transitions, through the Apollonian impulse to
beauty, even as roses break forth from thorny bushes. How else could
this so sensitive people, so vehement in its desires, so singularly
qualified for _sufferings_ have endured existence, if it had not been
exhibited to them in their gods, surrounded with a higher glory?
The same impulse which calls art into being, as the complement and
consummation of existence, seducing to a continuation of life, caused
also the Olympian world to arise, in which the Hellenic "will" held
up before itself a transfiguring mirror. Thus do the gods justify the
life of man, in that they themselves live it--the only satisfactory
Theodicy! Existence under the bright sunshine of such gods is regarded
as that which is desirable in itself, and the real _grief_ of the
Homeric men has reference to parting from it, especially to early
parting: so that we might now say of them, with a reversion of the
Silenian wisdom, that "to die early is worst of all for them, the
second worst is--some day to die at all." If once the lamentation is
heard, it will ring out again, of the short-lived Achilles, of the
leaf-like change and vicissitude of the human race, of the decay of
the heroic age. It is not unworthy of the greatest hero to long for a
continuation of life, ay, even as a day-labourer. So vehemently does
the "will," at the Apollonian stage of development, long for this
existence, so completely at one does the Homeric man feel himself with
it, that the very lamentation becomes its song of praise.

Here we must observe that this harmony which is so eagerly contemplated
by modern man, in fact, this oneness of man with nature, to express
which Schiller introduced the technical term "naïve," is by no means
such a simple, naturally resulting and, as it were, inevitable
condition, which _must_ be found at the gate of every culture leading
to a paradise of man: this could be believed only by an age which
sought to picture to itself Rousseau's Émile also as an artist,
and imagined it had found in Homer such an artist Émile, reared at
Nature's bosom. Wherever we meet with the "naïve" in art, it behoves
us to recognise the highest effect of the Apollonian culture, which
in the first place has always to overthrow some Titanic empire and
slay monsters, and which, through powerful dazzling representations
and pleasurable illusions, must have triumphed over a terrible depth
of world-contemplation and a most keen susceptibility to suffering.
But how seldom is the naïve--that complete absorption, in the beauty
of appearance--attained! And hence how inexpressibly sublime is
_Homer,_ who, as unit being, bears the same relation to this Apollonian
folk-culture as the unit dream-artist does to the dream-faculty of
the people and of Nature in general. The Homeric "naïveté" can be
comprehended only as the complete triumph of the Apollonian illusion:
it is the same kind of illusion as Nature so frequently employs to
compass her ends. The true goal is veiled by a phantasm: we stretch out
our hands for the latter, while Nature attains the former through our
illusion. In the Greeks the "will" desired to contemplate itself in the
transfiguration of the genius and the world of art; in order to glorify
themselves, its creatures had to feel themselves worthy of glory;
they had to behold themselves again in a higher sphere, without this
consummate world of contemplation acting as an imperative or reproach.
Such is the sphere of beauty, in which, as in a mirror, they saw their
images, the Olympians. With this mirroring of beauty the Hellenic will
combated its talent--correlative to the artistic--for suffering and for
the wisdom of suffering: and, as a monument of its victory, Homer, the
naïve artist, stands before us.



4.


Concerning this naïve artist the analogy of dreams will enlighten us to
some extent. When we realise to ourselves the dreamer, as, in the midst
of the illusion of the dream-world and without disturbing it, he calls
out to himself: "it is a dream, I will dream on"; when we must thence
infer a deep inner joy in dream-contemplation; when, on the other hand,
to be at all able to dream with this inner joy in contemplation, we
must have completely forgotten the day and its terrible obtrusiveness,
we may, under the direction of the dream-reading Apollo, interpret
all these phenomena to ourselves somewhat as follows. Though it is
certain that of the two halves of life, the waking and the dreaming,
the former appeals to us as by far the more preferred, important,
excellent and worthy of being lived, indeed, as that which alone is
lived: yet, with reference to that mysterious ground of our being of
which we are the phenomenon, I should, paradoxical as it may seem, be
inclined to maintain the very opposite estimate of the value of dream
life. For the more clearly I perceive in nature those all-powerful art
impulses, and in them a fervent longing for appearance, for redemption
through appearance, the more I feel myself driven to the metaphysical
assumption that the Verily-Existent and Primordial Unity, as the
Eternally Suffering and Self-Contradictory, requires the rapturous
vision, the joyful appearance, for its continuous salvation: which
appearance we, who are completely wrapt in it and composed of it, must
regard as the Verily Non-existent,--_i.e.,_ as a perpetual unfolding
in time, space and causality,--in other words, as empiric reality.
If we therefore waive the consideration of our own "reality" for the
present, if we conceive our empiric existence, and that of the world
generally, as a representation of the Primordial Unity generated every
moment, we shall then have to regard the dream as an _appearance of
appearance,_ hence as a still higher gratification of the primordial
desire for appearance. It is for this same reason that the innermost
heart of Nature experiences that indescribable joy in the naïve artist
and in the naïve work of art, which is likewise only "an appearance of
appearance." In a symbolic painting, _Raphael_, himself one of these
immortal "naïve" ones, has represented to us this depotentiating of
appearance to appearance, the primordial process of the naïve artist
and at the same time of Apollonian culture. In his _Transfiguration,_
the lower half, with the possessed boy, the despairing bearers, the
helpless, terrified disciples, shows to us the reflection of eternal
primordial pain, the sole basis of the world: the "appearance" here
is the counter-appearance of eternal Contradiction, the father of
things. Out of this appearance then arises, like an ambrosial vapour, a
visionlike new world of appearances, of which those wrapt in the first
appearance see nothing--a radiant floating in purest bliss and painless
Contemplation beaming from wide-open eyes. Here there is presented to
our view, in the highest symbolism of art, that Apollonian world of
beauty and its substratum, the terrible wisdom of Silenus, and we
comprehend, by intuition, their necessary interdependence. Apollo,
however, again appears to us as the apotheosis of the _principium
individuationis,_ in which alone the perpetually attained end of the
Primordial Unity, its redemption through appearance, is consummated: he
shows us, with sublime attitudes, how the entire world of torment is
necessary, that thereby the individual may be impelled to realise the
redeeming vision, and then, sunk in contemplation thereof, quietly sit
in his fluctuating barque, in the midst of the sea.

This apotheosis of individuation, if it be at all conceived as
imperative and laying down precepts, knows but one law--the individual,
_i.e.,_ the observance of the boundaries of the individual,
_measure_ in the Hellenic sense. Apollo, as ethical deity, demands
due proportion of his disciples, and, that this may be observed, he
demands self-knowledge. And thus, parallel to the æsthetic necessity
for beauty, there run the demands "know thyself" and "not too much,"
while presumption and undueness are regarded as the truly hostile
demons of the non-Apollonian sphere, hence as characteristics of the
pre-Apollonian age, that of the Titans, and of the extra-Apollonian
world, that of the barbarians. Because of his Titan-like love for
man, Prometheus had to be torn to pieces by vultures; because of his
excessive wisdom, which solved the riddle of the Sphinx, Œdipus had
to plunge into a bewildering vortex of monstrous crimes: thus did the
Delphic god interpret the Grecian past.

So also the effects wrought by the _Dionysian_ appeared "titanic" and
"barbaric" to the Apollonian Greek: while at the same time he could
not conceal from himself that he too was inwardly related to these
overthrown Titans and heroes. Indeed, he had to recognise still more
than this: his entire existence, with all its beauty and moderation,
rested on a hidden substratum of suffering and of knowledge, which
was again disclosed to him by the Dionysian. And lo! Apollo could not
live without Dionysus! The "titanic" and the "barbaric" were in the
end not less necessary than the Apollonian. And now let us imagine to
ourselves how the ecstatic tone of the Dionysian festival sounded in
ever more luring and bewitching strains into this artificially confined
world built on appearance and moderation, how in these strains all
the _undueness_ of nature, in joy, sorrow, and knowledge, even to
the transpiercing shriek, became audible: let us ask ourselves what
meaning could be attached to the psalmodising artist of Apollo, with
the phantom harp-sound, as compared with this demonic folk-song! The
muses of the arts of "appearance" paled before an art which, in its
intoxication, spoke the truth, the wisdom of Silenus cried "woe! woe!"
against the cheerful Olympians. The individual, with all his boundaries
and due proportions, went under in the self-oblivion of the Dionysian
states and forgot the Apollonian precepts. The _Undueness_ revealed
itself as truth, contradiction, the bliss born of pain, declared itself
but of the heart of nature. And thus, wherever the Dionysian prevailed,
the Apollonian was routed and annihilated. But it is quite as certain
that, where the first assault was successfully withstood, the authority
and majesty of the Delphic god exhibited itself as more rigid and
menacing than ever. For I can only explain to myself the _Doric_ state
and Doric art as a permanent war-camp of the Apollonian: only by
incessant opposition to the titanic-barbaric nature of the Dionysian
was it possible for an art so defiantly-prim, so encompassed with
bulwarks, a training so warlike and rigorous, a constitution so cruel
and relentless, to last for any length of time.

Up to this point we have enlarged upon the observation made at the
beginning of this essay: how the Dionysian and the Apollonian, in ever
new births succeeding and mutually augmenting one another, controlled
the Hellenic genius: how from out the age of "bronze," with its Titan
struggles and rigorous folk-philosophy, the Homeric world develops
under the fostering sway of the Apollonian impulse to beauty, how this
"naïve" splendour is again overwhelmed by the inbursting flood of the
Dionysian, and how against this new power the Apollonian rises to the
austere majesty of Doric art and the Doric view of things. If, then,
in this way, in the strife of these two hostile principles, the older
Hellenic history falls into four great periods of art, we are now
driven to inquire after the ulterior purpose of these unfoldings and
processes, unless perchance we should regard the last-attained period,
the period of Doric art, as the end and aim of these artistic impulses:
and here the sublime and highly celebrated art-work of _Attic tragedy_
and dramatic dithyramb presents itself to our view as the common
goal of both these impulses, whose mysterious union, after many and
long precursory struggles, found its glorious consummation in such a
child,--which is at once Antigone and Cassandra.



5.


We now approach the real purpose of our investigation, which aims
at acquiring a knowledge of the Dionyso-Apollonian genius and his
art-work, or at least an anticipatory understanding of the mystery of
the aforesaid union. Here we shall ask first of all where that new
germ which subsequently developed into tragedy and dramatic dithyramb
first makes itself perceptible in the Hellenic world. The ancients
themselves supply the answer in symbolic form, when they place _Homer_
and _Archilochus_ as the forefathers and torch-bearers of Greek poetry
side by side on gems, sculptures, etc., in the sure conviction that
only these two thoroughly original compeers, from whom a stream of
fire flows over the whole of Greek posterity, should be taken into
consideration. Homer, the aged dreamer sunk in himself, the type
of the Apollonian naïve artist, beholds now with astonishment the
impassioned genius of the warlike votary of the muses, Archilochus,
violently tossed to and fro on the billows of existence: and modern
æsthetics could only add by way of interpretation, that here the
"objective" artist is confronted by the first "subjective" artist.
But this interpretation is of little service to us, because we know
the subjective artist only as the poor artist, and in every type and
elevation of art we demand specially and first of all the conquest
of the Subjective, the redemption from the "ego" and the cessation
of every individual will and desire; indeed, we find it impossible
to believe in any truly artistic production, however insignificant,
without objectivity, without pure, interestless contemplation. Hence
our æsthetics must first solve the problem as to how the "lyrist" is
possible as an artist: he who according to the experience of all ages
continually says "I" and sings off to us the entire chromatic scale of
his passions and desires. This very Archilochus appals us, alongside
of Homer, by his cries of hatred and scorn, by the drunken outbursts
of his desire. Is not just he then, who has been called the first
subjective artist, the non-artist proper? But whence then the reverence
which was shown to him--the poet--in very remarkable utterances by the
Delphic oracle itself, the focus of "objective" art?

_Schiller_ has enlightened us concerning his poetic procedure by a
psychological observation, inexplicable to himself, yet not apparently
open to any objection. He acknowledges that as the preparatory state
to the act of poetising he had not perhaps before him or within him a
series of pictures with co-ordinate causality of thoughts, but rather
a _musical mood_ ("The perception with me is at first without a clear
and definite object; this forms itself later. A certain musical mood
of mind precedes, and only after this does the poetical idea follow
with me.") Add to this the most important phenomenon of all ancient
lyric poetry, _the union,_ regarded everywhere as natural, _of the
lyrist with the musician,_ their very identity, indeed,--compared
with which our modern lyric poetry is like the statue of a god without
a head,--and we may now, on the basis of our metaphysics of æsthetics
set forth above, interpret the lyrist to ourselves as follows. As
Dionysian artist he is in the first place become altogether one with
the Primordial Unity, its pain and contradiction, and he produces the
copy of this Primordial Unity as music, granting that music has been
correctly termed a repetition and a recast of the world; but now, under
the Apollonian dream-inspiration, this music again becomes visible
to him as in a _symbolic dream-picture._ The formless and intangible
reflection of the primordial pain in music, with its redemption in
appearance, then generates a second mirroring as a concrete symbol or
example. The artist has already surrendered his subjectivity in the
Dionysian process: the picture which now shows to him his oneness with
the heart of the world, is a dream-scene, which embodies the primordial
contradiction and primordial pain, together with the primordial joy, of
appearance. The "I" of the lyrist sounds therefore from the abyss of
being: its "subjectivity," in the sense of the modern æsthetes, is a
fiction. When Archilochus, the first lyrist of the Greeks, makes known
both his mad love and his contempt to the daughters of Lycambes, it is
not his passion which dances before us in orgiastic frenzy: we see
Dionysus and the Mænads, we see the drunken reveller Archilochus sunk
down to sleep--as Euripides depicts it in the Bacchæ, the sleep on the
high Alpine pasture, in the noonday sun:--and now Apollo approaches and
touches him with the laurel. The Dionyso-musical enchantment of the
sleeper now emits, as it were, picture sparks, lyrical poems, which in
their highest development are called tragedies and dramatic dithyrambs.

The plastic artist, as also the epic poet, who is related to him, is
sunk in the pure contemplation of pictures. The Dionysian musician
is, without any picture, himself just primordial pain and the
primordial re-echoing thereof. The lyric genius is conscious of a
world of pictures and symbols--growing out of the state of mystical
self-abnegation and oneness,--which has a colouring causality and
velocity quite different from that of the world of the plastic artist
and epic poet. While the latter lives in these pictures, and only in
them, with joyful satisfaction, and never grows tired of contemplating
them with love, even in their minutest characters, while even the
picture of the angry Achilles is to him but a picture, the angry
expression of which he enjoys with the dream-joy in appearance--so
that, by this mirror of appearance, he is guarded against being unified
and blending with his figures;--the pictures of the lyrist on the other
hand are nothing but _his very_ self and, as it were, only different
projections of himself, on account of which he as the moving centre
of this world is entitled to say "I": only of course this self is
not the same as that of the waking, empirically real man, but the
only verily existent and eternal self resting at the basis of things,
by means of the images whereof the lyric genius sees through even to
this basis of things. Now let us suppose that he beholds _himself_
also among these images as non-genius, _i.e.,_ his subject, the whole
throng of subjective passions and impulses of the will directed to a
definite object which appears real to him; if now it seems as if the
lyric genius and the allied non-genius were one, and as if the former
spoke that little word "I" of his own accord, this appearance will no
longer be able to lead us astray, as it certainly led those astray who
designated the lyrist as the subjective poet. In truth, Archilochus,
the passionately inflamed, loving and hating man, is but a vision of
the genius, who by this time is no longer Archilochus, but a genius
of the world, who expresses his primordial pain symbolically in the
figure of the man Archilochus: while the subjectively willing and
desiring man, Archilochus, can never at any time be a poet. It is by no
means necessary, however, that the lyrist should see nothing but the
phenomenon of the man Archilochus before him as a reflection of eternal
being; and tragedy shows how far the visionary world of the lyrist may
depart from this phenomenon, to which, of course, it is most intimately
related.

_Schopenhauer,_ who did not shut his eyes to the difficulty presented
by the lyrist in the philosophical contemplation of art, thought he
had found a way out of it, on which, however, I cannot accompany him;
while he alone, in his profound metaphysics of music, held in his
hands the means whereby this difficulty could be definitely removed:
as I believe I have removed it here in his spirit and to his honour.
In contrast to our view, he describes the peculiar nature of song
as follows[4] (_Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. 295):--"It is
the subject of the will, _i.e.,_ his own volition, which fills the
consciousness of the singer; often as an unbound and satisfied desire
(joy), but still more often as a restricted desire (grief), always as
an emotion, a passion, or an agitated frame of mind. Besides this,
however, and along with it, by the sight of surrounding nature, the
singer becomes conscious of himself as the subject of pure will-less
knowing, the unbroken, blissful peace of which now appears, in contrast
to the stress of desire, which is always restricted and always needy.
The feeling of this contrast, this alternation, is really what the
song as a whole expresses and what principally constitutes the lyrical
state of mind. In it pure knowing comes to us as it were to deliver us
from desire and the stress thereof: we follow, but only for an instant;
for desire, the remembrance of our personal ends, tears us anew from
peaceful contemplation; yet ever again the next beautiful surrounding
in which the pure will-less knowledge presents itself to us, allures
us away from desire. Therefore, in song and in the lyrical mood,
desire (the personal interest of the ends) and the pure perception of
the surrounding which presents itself, are wonderfully mingled with
each other; connections between them are sought for and imagined; the
subjective disposition, the affection of the will, imparts its own
hue to the contemplated surrounding, and conversely, the surroundings
communicate the reflex of their colour to the will. The true song is
the expression of the whole of this mingled and divided state of mind."

Who could fail to see in this description that lyric poetry is here
characterised as an imperfectly attained art, which seldom and only
as it were in leaps arrives at its goal, indeed, as a semi-art, the
essence of which is said to consist in this, that desire and pure
contemplation, _i.e.,_ the unæsthetic and the æsthetic condition, are
wonderfully mingled with each other? We maintain rather, that this
entire antithesis, according to which, as according to some standard
of value, Schopenhauer, too, still classifies the arts, the antithesis
between the subjective and the objective, is quite out of place in
æsthetics, inasmuch as the subject _i.e.,_ the desiring individual who
furthers his own egoistic ends, can be conceived only as the adversary,
not as the origin of art. In so far as the subject is the artist,
however, he has already been released from his individual will, and has
become as it were the medium, through which the one verily existent
Subject celebrates his redemption in appearance. For this one thing
must above all be clear to us, to our humiliation _and_ exaltation,
that the entire comedy of art is not at all performed, say, for our
betterment and culture, and that we are just as little the true authors
of this art-world: rather we may assume with regard to ourselves, that
its true author uses us as pictures and artistic projections, and that
we have our highest dignity in our significance as works of art--for
only as an _æsthetic phenomenon_ is existence and the world eternally
_justified:_--while of course our consciousness of this our specific
significance hardly differs from the kind of consciousness which the
soldiers painted on canvas have of the battle represented thereon.
Hence all our knowledge of art is at bottom quite illusory, because, as
knowing persons we are not one and identical with the Being who, as the
sole author and spectator of this comedy of art, prepares a perpetual
entertainment for himself. Only in so far as the genius in the act of
artistic production coalesces with this primordial artist of the world,
does he get a glimpse of the eternal essence of art, for in this state
he is, in a marvellous manner, like the weird picture of the fairy-tale
which can at will turn its eyes and behold itself; he is now at once
subject and object, at once poet, actor, and spectator.

With reference to Archilochus, it has been established by critical
research that he introduced the _folk-song_ into literature, and,
on account thereof, deserved, according to the general estimate of
the Greeks, his unique position alongside of Homer. But what is this
popular folk-song in contrast to the wholly Apollonian epos? What
else but the _perpetuum vestigium_ of a union of the Apollonian and
the Dionysian? Its enormous diffusion among all peoples, still further
enhanced by ever new births, testifies to the power of this artistic
double impulse of nature: which leaves its vestiges in the popular
song in like manner as the orgiastic movements of a people perpetuate
themselves in its music. Indeed, one might also furnish historical
proofs, that every period which is highly productive in popular songs
has been most violently stirred by Dionysian currents, which we must
always regard as the substratum and prerequisite of the popular song.

First of all, however, we regard the popular song as the musical mirror
of the world, as the Original melody, which now seeks for itself a
parallel dream-phenomenon and expresses it in poetry. _Melody is
therefore primary and universal,_ and as such may admit of several
objectivations, in several texts. Likewise, in the naïve estimation of
the people, it is regarded as by far the more important and necessary.
Melody generates the poem out of itself by an ever-recurring process.
_The strophic form of the popular song_ points to the same phenomenon,
which I always beheld with astonishment, till at last I found this
explanation. Any one who in accordance with this theory examines a
collection of popular songs, such as "Des Knaben Wunderhorn," will find
innumerable instances of the perpetually productive melody scattering
picture sparks all around: which in their variegation, their abrupt
change, their mad precipitance, manifest a power quite unknown to the
epic appearance and its steady flow. From the point of view of the
epos, this unequal and irregular pictorial world of lyric poetry must
be simply condemned: and the solemn epic rhapsodists of the Apollonian
festivals in the age of Terpander have certainly done so.

Accordingly, we observe that in the poetising of the popular song,
language is strained to its utmost _to imitate music;_ and hence a
new world of poetry begins with Archilochus, which is fundamentally
opposed to the Homeric. And in saying this we have pointed out the
only possible relation between poetry and music, between word and
tone: the word, the picture, the concept here seeks an expression
analogous to music and now experiences in itself the power of music.
In this sense we may discriminate between two main currents in the
history of the language of the Greek people, according as their
language imitated either the world of phenomena and of pictures, or the
world of music. One has only to reflect seriously on the linguistic
difference with regard to colour, syntactical structure, and vocabulary
in Homer and Pindar, in order to comprehend the significance of this
contrast; indeed, it becomes palpably clear to us that in the period
between Homer and Pindar the _orgiastic flute tones of Olympus_ must
have sounded forth, which, in an age as late as Aristotle's, when
music was infinitely more developed, transported people to drunken
enthusiasm, and which, when their influence was first felt, undoubtedly
incited all the poetic means of expression of contemporaneous man
to imitation. I here call attention to a familiar phenomenon of our
own times, against which our æsthetics raises many objections. We
again and again have occasion to observe how a symphony of Beethoven
compels the individual hearers to use figurative speech, though the
appearance presented by a collocation of the different pictorial
world generated by a piece of music may be never so fantastically
diversified and even contradictory. To practise its small wit on such
compositions, and to overlook a phenomenon which is certainly worth
explaining, is quite in keeping with this æsthetics. Indeed, even if
the tone-poet has spoken in pictures concerning a composition, when for
instance he designates a certain symphony as the "pastoral" symphony,
or a passage therein as "the scene by the brook," or another as the
"merry gathering of rustics," these are likewise only symbolical
representations born out of music--and not perhaps the imitated objects
of music--representations which can give us no information whatever
concerning the _Dionysian_ content of music, and which in fact have
no distinctive value of their own alongside of other pictorical
expressions. This process of a discharge of music in pictures we have
now to transfer to some youthful, linguistically productive people, to
get a notion as to how the strophic popular song originates, and how
the entire faculty of speech is stimulated by this new principle of
imitation of music.

If, therefore, we may regard lyric poetry as the effulguration of
music in pictures and concepts, we can now ask: "how does music
_appear_ in the mirror of symbolism and conception?" _It appears as
will,_ taking the word in the Schopenhauerian sense, _i.e.,_ as the
antithesis of the æsthetic, purely contemplative, and passive frame
of mind. Here, however, we must discriminate as sharply as possible
between the concept of essentiality and the concept of phenominality;
for music, according to its essence, cannot be will, because as such it
would have to be wholly banished from the domain of art--for the will
is the unæsthetic-in-itself;--yet it appears as will. For in order to
express the phenomenon of music in pictures, the lyrist requires all
the stirrings of passion, from the whispering of infant desire to the
roaring of madness. Under the impulse to speak of music in Apollonian
symbols, he conceives of all nature, and himself therein, only as the
eternally willing, desiring, longing existence. But in so far as he
interprets music by means of pictures, he himself rests in the quiet
calm of Apollonian contemplation, however much all around him which
he beholds through the medium of music is in a state of confused and
violent motion. Indeed, when he beholds himself through this same
medium, his own image appears to him in a state of unsatisfied feeling:
his own willing, longing, moaning and rejoicing are to him symbols by
which he interprets music. Such is the phenomenon of the lyrist: as
Apollonian genius he interprets music through the image of the will,
while he himself, completely released from the avidity of the will, is
the pure, undimmed eye of day.

Our whole disquisition insists on this, that lyric poetry is dependent
on the spirit of music just as music itself in its absolute sovereignty
does not _require_ the picture and the concept, but only _endures_
them as accompaniments. The poems of the lyrist can express nothing
which has not already been contained in the vast universality and
absoluteness of the music which compelled him to use figurative
speech. By no means is it possible for language adequately to render
the cosmic symbolism of music, for the very reason that music stands
in symbolic relation to the primordial contradiction and primordial
pain in the heart of the Primordial Unity, and therefore symbolises a
sphere which is above all appearance and before all phenomena. Rather
should we say that all phenomena, compared with it, are but symbols:
hence _language,_ as the organ and symbol of phenomena, cannot at all
disclose the innermost essence, of music; language can only be in
superficial contact with music when it attempts to imitate music; while
the profoundest significance of the latter cannot be brought one step
nearer to us by all the eloquence of lyric poetry.

We shall now have to avail ourselves of all the principles of art
hitherto considered, in order to find our way through the labyrinth,
as we must designate _the origin of Greek tragedy._ I shall not be
charged with absurdity in saying that the problem of this origin has
as yet not even been seriously stated, not to say solved, however
often the fluttering tatters of ancient tradition have been sewed
together in sundry combinations and torn asunder again. This tradition
tells us in the most unequivocal terms, _that tragedy sprang from the
tragic chorus,_ and was originally only chorus and nothing but chorus:
and hence we feel it our duty to look into the heart of this tragic
chorus as being the real proto-drama, without in the least contenting
ourselves with current art-phraseology--according to which the chorus
is the ideal spectator, or represents the people in contrast to the
regal side of the scene. The latter explanatory notion, which sounds
sublime to many a politician--that the immutable moral law was embodied
by the democratic Athenians in the popular chorus, which always carries
its point over the passionate excesses and extravagances of kings--may
be ever so forcibly suggested by an observation of Aristotle: still
it has no bearing on the original formation of tragedy, inasmuch
as the entire antithesis of king and people, and, in general, the
whole politico-social sphere, is excluded from the purely religious
beginnings of tragedy; but, considering the well-known classical
form of the chorus in Æschylus and Sophocles, we should even deem
it blasphemy to speak here of the anticipation of a "constitutional
representation of the people," from which blasphemy others have not
shrunk, however. The ancient governments knew of no constitutional
representation of the people _in praxi,_ and it is to be hoped that
they did not even so much as "anticipate" it in tragedy.

Much more celebrated than this political explanation of the chorus is
the notion of A. W. Schlegel, who advises us to regard the chorus, in
a manner, as the essence and extract of the crowd of spectators,--as
the "ideal spectator." This view when compared with the historical
tradition that tragedy was originally only chorus, reveals itself
in its true character, as a crude, unscientific, yet brilliant
assertion, which, however, has acquired its brilliancy only through
its concentrated form of expression, through the truly Germanic bias
in favour of whatever is called "ideal," and through our momentary
astonishment. For we are indeed astonished the moment we compare our
well-known theatrical public with this chorus, and ask ourselves if it
could ever be possible to idealise something analogous to the Greek
chorus out of such a public. We tacitly deny this, and now wonder
as much at the boldness of Schlegel's assertion as at the totally
different nature of the Greek public. For hitherto we always believed
that the true spectator, be he who he may, had always to remain
conscious of having before him a work of art, and not an empiric
reality: whereas the tragic chorus of the Greeks is compelled to
recognise real beings in the figures of the stage. The chorus of the
Oceanides really believes that it sees before it the Titan Prometheus,
and considers itself as real as the god of the scene. And are we to
own that he is the highest and purest type of spectator, who, like the
Oceanides, regards Prometheus as real and present in body? And is it
characteristic of the ideal spectator that he should run on the stage
and free the god from his torments? We had believed in an æsthetic
public, and considered the individual spectator the better qualified
the more he was capable of viewing a work of art as art, that is,
æsthetically; but now the Schlegelian expression has intimated to us,
that the perfect ideal spectator does not at all suffer the world of
the scenes to act æsthetically on him, but corporeo-empirically. Oh,
these Greeks! we have sighed; they will upset our æsthetics! But once
accustomed to it, we have reiterated the saying of Schlegel, as often
as the subject of the chorus has been broached.

But the tradition which is so explicit here speaks against Schlegel:
the chorus as such, without the stage,--the primitive form of
tragedy,--and the chorus of ideal spectators do not harmonise. What
kind of art would that be which was extracted from the concept of the
spectator, and whereof we are to regard the "spectator as such" as the
true form? The spectator without the play is something absurd. We fear
that the birth of tragedy can be explained neither by the high esteem
for the moral intelligence of the multitude nor by the concept of the
spectator without the play; and we regard the problem as too deep to be
even so much as touched by such superficial modes of contemplation.

An infinitely more valuable insight into the signification of the
chorus had already been displayed by Schiller in the celebrated Preface
to his Bride of Messina, where he regarded the chorus as a living wall
which tragedy draws round herself to guard her from contact with the
world of reality, and to preserve her ideal domain and poetical freedom.

It is with this, his chief weapon, that Schiller combats the ordinary
conception of the natural, the illusion ordinarily required in
dramatic poetry. He contends that while indeed the day on the stage is
merely artificial, the architecture only symbolical, and the metrical
dialogue purely ideal in character, nevertheless an erroneous view
still prevails in the main: that it is not enough to tolerate merely
as a poetical license _that_ which is in reality the essence of all
poetry. The introduction of the chorus is, he says, the decisive step
by which war is declared openly and honestly against all naturalism
in art.--It is, methinks, for disparaging this mode of contemplation
that our would-be superior age has coined the disdainful catchword
"pseudo-idealism." I fear, however, that we on the other hand with our
present worship of the natural and the real have landed at the nadir
of all idealism, namely in the region of cabinets of wax-figures. An
art indeed exists also here, as in certain novels much in vogue at
present: but let no one pester us with the claim that by this art the
Schiller-Goethian "Pseudo-idealism" has been vanquished.

It is indeed an "ideal" domain, as Schiller rightly perceived,
upon--which the Greek satyric chorus, the chorus of primitive tragedy,
was wont to walk, a domain raised far above the actual path of
mortals. The Greek framed for this chorus the suspended scaffolding of
a fictitious _natural state_ and placed thereon fictitious _natural
beings._ It is on this foundation that tragedy grew up, and so it
could of course dispense from the very first with a painful portrayal
of reality. Yet it is, not an arbitrary world placed by fancy betwixt
heaven and earth; rather is it a world possessing the same reality
and trustworthiness that Olympus with its dwellers possessed for the
believing Hellene. The satyr, as being the Dionysian chorist, lives
in a religiously acknowledged reality under the sanction of the myth
and cult. That tragedy begins with him, that the Dionysian wisdom of
tragedy speaks through him, is just as surprising a phenomenon to us
as, in general, the derivation of tragedy from the chorus. Perhaps
we shall get a starting-point for our inquiry, if I put forward the
proposition that the satyr, the fictitious natural being, is to the
man of culture what Dionysian music is to civilisation. Concerning
this latter, Richard Wagner says that it is neutralised by music even
as lamplight by daylight. In like manner, I believe, the Greek man of
culture felt himself neutralised in the presence of the satyric chorus:
and this is the most immediate effect of the Dionysian tragedy, that
the state and society, and, in general, the gaps between man and man
give way to an overwhelming feeling of oneness, which leads back to
the heart of nature. The metaphysical comfort,--with which, as I have
here intimated, every true tragedy dismisses us--that, in spite of
the perpetual change of phenomena, life at bottom is indestructibly
powerful and pleasurable, this comfort appears with corporeal lucidity
as the satyric chorus, as the chorus of natural beings, who live
ineradicable as it were behind all civilisation, and who, in spite of
the ceaseless change of generations and the history of nations, remain
for ever the same.

With this chorus the deep-minded Hellene, who is so singularly
qualified for the most delicate and severe suffering, consoles
himself:--he who has glanced with piercing eye into the very heart of
the terrible destructive processes of so-called universal history, as
also into the cruelty of nature, and is in danger of longing for a
Buddhistic negation of the will. Art saves him, and through art life
saves him--for herself.

For we must know that in the rapture of the Dionysian state, with its
annihilation of the ordinary bounds and limits of existence, there is
a _lethargic_ element, wherein all personal experiences of the past
are submerged. It is by this gulf of oblivion that the everyday world
and the world of Dionysian reality are separated from each other. But
as soon as this everyday reality rises again in consciousness, it is
felt as such, and nauseates us; an ascetic will-paralysing mood is
the fruit of these states. In this sense the Dionysian man may be
said to resemble Hamlet: both have for once seen into the true nature
of things,--they have _perceived,_ but they are loath to act; for
their action cannot change the eternal nature of things; they regard
it as shameful or ridiculous that one should require of them to set
aright the time which is out of joint. Knowledge kills action, action
requires the veil of illusion--it is this lesson which Hamlet teaches,
and not the cheap wisdom of John-a-Dreams who from too much reflection,
as it were from a surplus of possibilities, does not arrive at action
at all. Not reflection, no!--true knowledge, insight into appalling
truth, preponderates over all motives inciting to action, in Hamlet as
well as in the Dionysian man. No comfort avails any longer; his longing
goes beyond a world after death, beyond the gods themselves; existence
with its glittering reflection in the gods, or in an immortal other
world is abjured. In the consciousness of the truth he has perceived,
man now sees everywhere only the awfulness or the absurdity of
existence, he now understands the symbolism in the fate of Ophelia, he
now discerns the wisdom of the sylvan god Silenus: and loathing seizes
him.

Here, in this extremest danger of the will, _art_ approaches, as a
saving and healing enchantress; she alone is able to transform these
nauseating reflections on the awfulness or absurdity of existence
into representations wherewith it is possible to live: these are the
representations of the _sublime_ as the artistic subjugation of the
awful, and the _comic_ as the artistic delivery from the nausea of
the absurd. The satyric chorus of dithyramb is the saving deed of
Greek art; the paroxysms described above spent their force in the
intermediary world of these Dionysian followers.

The satyr, like the idyllic shepherd of our more recent time, is the
offspring of a longing after the Primitive and the Natural; but mark
with what firmness and fearlessness the Greek embraced the man of
the woods, and again, how coyly and mawkishly the modern man dallied
with the flattering picture of a tender, flute-playing, soft-natured
shepherd! Nature, on which as yet no knowledge has been at work,
which maintains unbroken barriers to culture--this is what the Greek
saw in his satyr, which still was not on this account supposed to
coincide with the ape. On the contrary: it was the archetype of
man, the embodiment of his highest and strongest emotions, as the
enthusiastic reveller enraptured By the proximity of his god, as the
fellow-suffering companion in whom the suffering of the god repeats
itself, as the herald of wisdom speaking from the very depths of
nature, as the emblem of the sexual omnipotence of nature, which the
Greek was wont to contemplate with reverential awe. The satyr was
something sublime and godlike: he could not but appear so, especially
to the sad and wearied eye of the Dionysian man. He would have been
offended by our spurious tricked-up shepherd, while his eye dwelt
with sublime satisfaction on the naked and unstuntedly magnificent
characters of nature: here the illusion of culture was brushed away
from the archetype of man; here the true man, the bearded satyr,
revealed himself, who shouts joyfully to his god. Before him the
cultured man shrank to a lying caricature. Schiller is right also
with reference to these beginnings of tragic art: the chorus is a
living bulwark against the onsets of reality, because it--the satyric
chorus--portrays existence more truthfully, more realistically, more
perfectly than the cultured man who ordinarily considers himself as the
only reality. The sphere of poetry does not lie outside the world, like
some fantastic impossibility of a poet's imagination: it seeks to be
the very opposite, the unvarnished expression of truth, and must for
this very reason cast aside the false finery of that supposed reality
of the cultured man. The contrast between this intrinsic truth of
nature and the falsehood of culture, which poses as the only reality,
is similar to that existing between the eternal kernel of things, the
thing in itself, and the collective world of phenomena. And even as
tragedy, with its metaphysical comfort, points to the eternal life of
this kernel of existence, notwithstanding the perpetual dissolution of
phenomena, so the symbolism of the satyric chorus already expresses
figuratively this primordial relation between the thing in itself and
phenomenon. The idyllic shepherd of the modern man is but a copy of the
sum of the illusions of culture which he calls nature; the Dionysian
Greek desires truth and nature in their most potent form;--he sees
himself metamorphosed into the satyr.

The revelling crowd of the votaries of Dionysus rejoices, swayed by
such moods and perceptions, the power of which transforms them before
their own eyes, so that they imagine they behold themselves as
reconstituted genii of nature, as satyrs. The later constitution of the
tragic chorus is the artistic imitation of this natural phenomenon,
which of course required a separation of the Dionysian spectators from
the enchanted Dionysians. However, we must never lose sight of the fact
that the public of the Attic tragedy rediscovered itself in the chorus
of the orchestra, that there was in reality no antithesis of public
and chorus: for all was but one great sublime chorus of dancing and
singing satyrs, or of such as allowed themselves to be represented by
the satyrs. The Schlegelian observation must here reveal itself to us
in a deeper sense. The chorus is the "ideal spectator"[5] in so far as
it is the only _beholder,_[6] the beholder of the visionary world of
the scene. A public of spectators, as known to us, was unknown to the
Greeks. In their theatres the terraced structure of the spectators'
space rising in concentric arcs enabled every one, in the strictest
sense, to _overlook_ the entire world of culture around him, and in
surfeited contemplation to imagine himself a chorist. According to
this view, then, we may call the chorus in its primitive stage in
proto-tragedy, a self-mirroring of the Dionysian man: a phenomenon
which may be best exemplified by the process of the actor, who, if he
be truly gifted, sees hovering before his eyes with almost tangible
perceptibility the character he is to represent. The satyric chorus
is first of all a vision of the Dionysian throng, just as the world
of the stage is, in turn, a vision of the satyric chorus: the power
of this vision is great enough to render the eye dull and insensible
to the impression of "reality," to the presence of the cultured men
occupying the tiers of seats on every side. The form of the Greek
theatre reminds one of a lonesome mountain-valley: the architecture of
the scene appears like a luminous cloud-picture which the Bacchants
swarming on the mountains behold from the heights, as the splendid
encirclement in the midst of which the image of Dionysus is revealed to
them.

Owing to our learned conception of the elementary artistic processes,
this artistic proto-phenomenon, which is here introduced to explain
the tragic chorus, is almost shocking: while nothing can be more
certain than that the poet is a poet only in that he beholds himself
surrounded by forms which live and act before him, into the innermost
being of which his glance penetrates. By reason of a strange defeat in
our capacities, we modern men are apt to represent to ourselves the
æsthetic proto-phenomenon as too complex and abstract. For the true
poet the metaphor is not a rhetorical figure, but a vicarious image
which actually hovers before him in place of a concept. The character
is not for him an aggregate composed of a studied collection of
particular traits, but an irrepressibly live person appearing before
his eyes, and differing only from the corresponding vision of the
painter by its ever continued life and action. Why is it that Homer
sketches much more vividly[7] than all the other poets? Because he
contemplates[8] much more. We talk so abstractly about poetry, because
we are all wont to be bad poets. At bottom the æsthetic phenomenon is
simple: let a man but have the faculty of perpetually seeing a lively
play and of constantly living surrounded by hosts of spirits, then he
is a poet: let him but feel the impulse to transform himself and to
talk from out the bodies and souls of others, then he is a dramatist.

The Dionysian excitement is able to impart to a whole mass of men
this artistic faculty of seeing themselves surrounded by such a host
of spirits, with whom they know themselves to be inwardly one. This
function of the tragic chorus is the _dramatic_ proto-phenomenon: to
see one's self transformed before one's self, and then to act as if
one had really entered into another body, into another character. This
function stands at the beginning of the development of the drama.
Here we have something different from the rhapsodist, who does not
blend with his pictures, but only sees them, like the painter, with
contemplative eye outside of him; here we actually have a surrender
of the individual by his entering into another nature. Moreover this
phenomenon appears in the form of an epidemic: a whole throng feels
itself metamorphosed in this wise. Hence it is that the dithyramb is
essentially different from every other variety of the choric song. The
virgins, who with laurel twigs in their hands solemnly proceed to
the temple of Apollo and sing a processional hymn, remain what they
are and retain their civic names: the dithyrambic chorus is a chorus
of transformed beings, whose civic past and social rank are totally
forgotten: they have become the timeless servants of their god that
live aloof from all the spheres of society. Every other variety of
the choric lyric of the Hellenes is but an enormous enhancement of
the Apollonian unit-singer: while in the dithyramb we have before us
a community of unconscious actors, who mutually regard themselves as
transformed among one another.

This enchantment is the prerequisite of all dramatic art. In this
enchantment the Dionysian reveller sees himself as a satyr, _and as
satyr he in turn beholds the god,_ that is, in his transformation he
sees a new vision outside him as the Apollonian consummation of his
state. With this new vision the drama is complete.

According to this view, we must understand Greek tragedy as the
Dionysian chorus, which always disburdens itself anew in an Apollonian
world of pictures. The choric parts, therefore, with which tragedy is
interlaced, are in a manner the mother-womb of the entire so-called
dialogue, that is, of the whole stage-world, of the drama proper. In
several successive outbursts does this primordial basis of tragedy beam
forth the vision of the drama, which is a dream-phenomenon throughout,
and, as such, epic in character: on the other hand, however, as
objectivation of a Dionysian state, it does not represent the
Apollonian redemption in appearance, but, conversely, the dissolution
of the individual and his unification with primordial existence.
Accordingly, the drama is the Apollonian embodiment of Dionysian
perceptions and influences, and is thereby separated from the epic as
by an immense gap.

The _chorus_ of Greek tragedy, the symbol of the mass of the people
moved by Dionysian excitement, is thus fully explained by our
conception of it as here set forth. Whereas, being accustomed to the
position of a chorus on the modern stage, especially an operatic
chorus, we could never comprehend why the tragic chorus of the Greeks
should be older, more primitive, indeed, more important than the
"action" proper,--as has been so plainly declared by the voice of
tradition; whereas, furthermore, we could not reconcile with this
traditional paramount importance and primitiveness the fact of the
chorus' being composed only of humble, ministering beings; indeed, at
first only of goatlike satyrs; whereas, finally, the orchestra before
the scene was always a riddle to us; we have learned to comprehend at
length that the scene, together with the action, was fundamentally
and originally conceived only as a _vision,_ that the only reality
is just the chorus, which of itself generates the vision and speaks
thereof with the entire symbolism of dancing, tone, and word. This
chorus beholds in the vision its lord and master Dionysus, and is thus
for ever the _serving_ chorus: it sees how he, the god, suffers and
glorifies himself, and therefore does not itself _act_. But though its
attitude towards the god is throughout the attitude of ministration,
this is nevertheless the highest expression, the Dionysian expression
of _Nature,_ and therefore, like Nature herself, the chorus utters
oracles and wise sayings when transported with enthusiasm: as
_fellow-sufferer_ it is also the _sage_ proclaiming truth from out the
heart of Nature. Thus, then, originates the fantastic figure, which
seems so shocking, of the wise and enthusiastic satyr, who is at the
same time "the dumb man" in contrast to the god: the image of Nature
and her strongest impulses, yea, the symbol of Nature, and at the same
time the herald of her art and wisdom: musician, poet, dancer, and
visionary in one person.

Agreeably to this view, and agreeably to tradition, _Dionysus,_ the
proper stage-hero and focus of vision, is not at first actually present
in the oldest period of tragedy, but is only imagined as present:
_i.e.,_ tragedy is originally only "chorus" and not "drama." Later
on the attempt is made to exhibit the god as real and to display the
visionary figure together with its glorifying encirclement before the
eyes of all; it is here that the "drama" in the narrow sense of the
term begins. To the dithyrambic chorus is now assigned the task of
exciting the minds of the hearers to such a pitch of Dionysian frenzy,
that, when the tragic hero appears on the stage, they do not behold
in him, say, the unshapely masked man, but a visionary figure, born
as it were of their own ecstasy. Let us picture Admetes thinking in
profound meditation of his lately departed wife Alcestis, and quite
consuming himself in spiritual contemplation thereof--when suddenly
the veiled figure of a woman resembling her in form and gait is led
towards him: let us picture his sudden trembling anxiety, his agitated
comparisons, his instinctive conviction--and we shall have an analogon
to the sensation with which the spectator, excited to Dionysian frenzy,
saw the god approaching on the stage, a god with whose sufferings he
had already become identified. He involuntarily transferred the entire
picture of the god, fluttering magically before his soul, to this
masked figure and resolved its reality as it were into a phantasmal
unreality. This is the Apollonian dream-state, in which the world
of day is veiled, and a new world, clearer, more intelligible, more
striking than the former, and nevertheless more shadowy, is ever born
anew in perpetual change before our eyes. We accordingly recognise in
tragedy a thorough-going stylistic contrast: the language, colour,
flexibility and dynamics of the dialogue fall apart in the Dionysian
lyrics of the chorus on the one hand, and in the Apollonian dream-world
of the scene on the other, into entirely separate spheres of
expression. The Apollonian appearances, in which Dionysus objectifies
himself, are no longer "ein ewiges Meer, ein wechselnd Weben, ein
glühend Leben,"[9] as is the music of the chorus, they are no longer
the forces merely felt, but not condensed into a picture, by which
the inspired votary of Dionysus divines the proximity of his god: the
clearness and firmness of epic form now speak to him from the scene,
Dionysus now no longer speaks through forces, but as an epic hero,
almost in the language of Homer.

Whatever rises to the surface in the dialogue of the Apollonian part
of Greek tragedy, appears simple, transparent, beautiful. In this
sense the dialogue is a copy of the Hellene, whose nature reveals
itself in the dance, because in the dance the greatest energy is merely
potential, but betrays itself nevertheless in flexible and vivacious
movements. The language of the Sophoclean heroes, for instance,
surprises us by its Apollonian precision and clearness, so that we at
once imagine we see into the innermost recesses of their being, and
marvel not a little that the way to these recesses is so short. But
if for the moment we disregard the character of the hero which rises
to the surface and grows visible--and which at bottom is nothing but
the light-picture cast on a dark wall, that is, appearance through and
through,--if rather we enter into the myth which projects itself in
these bright mirrorings, we shall of a sudden experience a phenomenon
which bears a reverse relation to one familiar in optics. When, after
a vigorous effort to gaze into the sun, we turn away blinded, we have
dark-coloured spots before our eyes as restoratives, so to speak;
while, on the contrary, those light-picture phenomena of the Sophoclean
hero,--in short, the Apollonian of the mask,--are the necessary
productions of a glance into the secret and terrible things of nature,
as it were shining spots to heal the eye which dire night has seared.
Only in this sense can we hope to be able to grasp the true meaning of
the serious and significant notion of "Greek cheerfulness"; while of
course we encounter the misunderstood notion of this cheerfulness, as
resulting from a state of unendangered comfort, on all the ways and
paths of the present time.

The most sorrowful figure of the Greek stage, the hapless _Œdipus,_
was understood by Sophocles as the noble man, who in spite of his
wisdom was destined to error and misery, but nevertheless through
his extraordinary sufferings ultimately exerted a magical, wholesome
influence on all around him, which continues effective even after
his death. The noble man does not sin; this is what the thoughtful
poet wishes to tell us: all laws, all natural order, yea, the moral
world itself, may be destroyed through his action, but through this
very action a higher magic circle of influences is brought into play,
which establish a new world on the ruins of the old that has been
overthrown. This is what the poet, in so far as he is at the same time
a religious thinker, wishes to tell us: as poet, he shows us first of
all a wonderfully complicated legal mystery, which the judge slowly
unravels, link by link, to his own destruction. The truly Hellenic
delight at this dialectical loosening is so great, that a touch of
surpassing cheerfulness is thereby communicated to the entire play,
which everywhere blunts the edge of the horrible presuppositions of the
procedure. In the "Œdipus at Colonus" we find the same cheerfulness,
elevated, however, to an infinite transfiguration: in contrast to
the aged king, subjected to an excess of misery, and exposed solely
as a _sufferer_ to all that befalls him, we have here a supermundane
cheerfulness, which descends from a divine sphere and intimates to
us that in his purely passive attitude the hero attains his highest
activity, the influence of which extends far beyond his life, while
his earlier conscious musing and striving led him only to passivity.
Thus, then, the legal knot of the fable of Œdipus, which to mortal
eyes appears indissolubly entangled, is slowly unravelled--and the
profoundest human joy comes upon us in the presence of this divine
counterpart of dialectics. If this explanation does justice to the
poet, it may still be asked whether the substance of the myth is
thereby exhausted; and here it turns out that the entire conception
of the poet is nothing but the light-picture which healing nature
holds up to us after a glance into the abyss. Œdipus, the murderer of
his father, the husband of his mother, Œdipus, the interpreter of the
riddle of the Sphinx! What does the mysterious triad of these deeds
of destiny tell us? There is a primitive popular belief, especially
in Persia, that a wise Magian can be born only of incest: which
we have forthwith to interpret to ourselves with reference to the
riddle-solving and mother-marrying Œdipus, to the effect that when
the boundary of the present and future, the rigid law of individuation
and, in general, the intrinsic spell of nature, are broken by prophetic
and magical powers, an extraordinary counter-naturalness--as, in this
case, incest--must have preceded as a cause; for how else could one
force nature to surrender her secrets but by victoriously opposing her,
_i.e.,_ by means of the Unnatural? It is this intuition which I see
imprinted in the awful triad of the destiny of Œdipus: the very man
who solves the riddle of nature--that double-constituted Sphinx--must
also, as the murderer of his father and husband of his mother, break
the holiest laws of nature. Indeed, it seems as if the myth sought to
whisper into our ears that wisdom, especially Dionysian wisdom, is
an unnatural abomination, and that whoever, through his knowledge,
plunges nature into an abyss of annihilation, must also experience
the dissolution of nature in himself. "The sharpness of wisdom turns
round upon the sage: wisdom is a crime against nature": such terrible
expressions does the myth call out to us: but the Hellenic poet touches
like a sunbeam the sublime and formidable Memnonian statue of the myth,
so that it suddenly begins to sound--in Sophoclean melodies.

With the glory of passivity I now contrast the glory of activity which
illuminates the _Prometheus_ of Æschylus. That which Æschylus the
thinker had to tell us here, but which as a poet he only allows us to
surmise by his symbolic picture, the youthful Goethe succeeded in
disclosing to us in the daring words of his Prometheus:--

    "Hier sitz' ich, forme Menschen
    Nach meinem Bilde,
    Ein Geschlecht, das mir gleich sei,
    Zu leiden, zu weinen,
    Zu geniessen und zu freuen sich,
    Und dein nicht zu achten,
    Wie ich!"[10]

Man, elevating himself to the rank of the Titans, acquires his culture
by his own efforts, and compels the gods to unite with him, because
in his self-sufficient wisdom he has their existence and their limits
in his hand. What is most wonderful, however, in this Promethean
form, which according to its fundamental conception is the specific
hymn of impiety, is the profound Æschylean yearning for _justice_:
the untold sorrow of the bold "single-handed being" on the one hand,
and the divine need, ay, the foreboding of a twilight of the gods, on
the other, the power of these two worlds of suffering constraining
to reconciliation, to metaphysical oneness--all this suggests most
forcibly the central and main position of the Æschylean view of
things, which sees Moira as eternal justice enthroned above gods and
men. In view of the astonishing boldness with which Æschylus places the
Olympian world on his scales of justice, it must be remembered that
the deep-minded Greek had an immovably firm substratum of metaphysical
thought in his mysteries, and that all his sceptical paroxysms could
be discharged upon the Olympians. With reference to these deities,
the Greek artist, in particular, had an obscure feeling as to mutual
dependency: and it is just in the Prometheus of Æschylus that this
feeling is symbolised. The Titanic artist found in himself the
daring belief that he could create men and at least destroy Olympian
deities: namely, by his superior wisdom, for which, to be sure, he had
to atone by eternal suffering. The splendid "can-ing" of the great
genius, bought too cheaply even at the price of eternal suffering,
the stern pride of the _artist_: this is the essence and soul of
Æschylean poetry, while Sophocles in his Œdipus preludingly strikes up
the victory-song of the _saint_. But even this interpretation which
Æschylus has given to the myth does not fathom its astounding depth of
terror; the fact is rather that the artist's delight in unfolding, the
cheerfulness of artistic creating bidding defiance to all calamity,
is but a shining stellar and nebular image reflected in a black sea
of sadness. The tale of Prometheus is an original possession of the
entire Aryan family of races, and documentary evidence of their
capacity for the profoundly tragic; indeed, it is not improbable that
this myth has the same characteristic significance for the Aryan
race that the myth of the fall of man has for the Semitic, and that
there is a relationship between the two myths like that of brother and
sister. The presupposition of the Promethean myth is the transcendent
value which a naïve humanity attach to _fire_ as the true palladium
of every ascending culture: that man, however, should dispose at will
of this fire, and should not receive it only as a gift from heaven,
as the igniting lightning or the warming solar flame, appeared to the
contemplative primordial men as crime and robbery of the divine nature.
And thus the first philosophical problem at once causes a painful,
irreconcilable antagonism between man and God, and puts as it were
a mass of rock at the gate of every culture. The best and highest
that men can acquire they obtain by a crime, and must now in their
turn take upon themselves its consequences, namely the whole flood of
sufferings and sorrows with which the offended celestials _must_ visit
the nobly aspiring race of man: a bitter reflection, which, by the
_dignity_ it confers on crime, contrasts strangely with the Semitic
myth of the fall of man, in which curiosity, beguilement, seducibility,
wantonness,--in short, a whole series of pre-eminently feminine
passions,--were regarded as the origin of evil. What distinguishes
the Aryan representation is the sublime view of _active sin_ as the
properly Promethean virtue, which suggests at the same time the ethical
basis of pessimistic tragedy as the _justification_ of human evil--of
human guilt as well as of the suffering incurred thereby. The misery in
the essence of things--which the contemplative Aryan is not disposed
to explain away--the antagonism in the heart of the world, manifests
itself to him as a medley of different worlds, for instance, a Divine
and a human world, each of which is in the right individually, but
as a separate existence alongside of another has to suffer for its
individuation. With the heroic effort made by the individual for
universality, in his attempt to pass beyond the bounds of individuation
and become the _one_ universal being, he experiences in himself the
primordial contradiction concealed in the essence of things, _i.e.,_
he trespasses and suffers. Accordingly crime[11] is understood by
the Aryans to be a man, sin[12] by the Semites a woman; as also, the
original crime is committed by man, the original sin by woman. Besides,
the witches' chorus says:

    "Wir nehmen das nicht so genau:
    Mit tausend Schritten macht's die Frau;
    Doch wie sie auch sich eilen kann
    Mit einem Sprunge macht's der Mann."[13]

He who understands this innermost core of the tale of
Prometheus--namely the necessity of crime imposed on the titanically
striving individual--will at once be conscious of the un-Apollonian
nature of this pessimistic representation: for Apollo seeks to pacify
individual beings precisely by drawing boundary lines between them,
and by again and again calling attention thereto, with his requirements
of self-knowledge and due proportion, as the holiest laws of the
universe. In order, however, to prevent the form from congealing to
Egyptian rigidity and coldness in consequence of this Apollonian
tendency, in order to prevent the extinction of the motion of the
entire lake in the effort to prescribe to the individual wave its path
and compass, the high tide of the Dionysian tendency destroyed from
time to time all the little circles in which the one-sided Apollonian
"will" sought to confine the Hellenic world. The suddenly swelling
tide of the Dionysian then takes the separate little wave-mountains of
individuals on its back, just as the brother of Prometheus, the Titan
Atlas, does with the earth. This Titanic impulse, to become as it were
the Atlas of all individuals, and to carry them on broad shoulders
higher and higher, farther and farther, is what the Promethean and the
Dionysian have in common. In this respect the Æschylean Prometheus is
a Dionysian mask, while, in the afore-mentioned profound yearning for
justice, Æschylus betrays to the intelligent observer his paternal
descent from Apollo, the god of individuation and of the boundaries
of justice. And so the double-being of the Æschylean Prometheus, his
conjoint Dionysian and Apollonian nature, might be thus expressed in
an abstract formula: "Whatever exists is alike just and unjust, and
equally justified in both."

It is an indisputable tradition that Greek tragedy in its earliest
form had for its theme only the sufferings of Dionysus, and that for
some time the only stage-hero therein was simply Dionysus himself.
With the same confidence, however, we can maintain that not until
Euripides did Dionysus cease to be the tragic hero, and that in fact
all the celebrated figures of the Greek stage--Prometheus, Œdipus,
etc.--are but masks of this original hero, Dionysus. The presence of a
god behind all these masks is the one essential cause of the typical
"ideality," so oft exciting wonder, of these celebrated figures. Some
one, I know not whom, has maintained that all individuals are comic as
individuals and are consequently un-tragic: from whence it might be
inferred that the Greeks in general _could_ not endure individuals on
the tragic stage. And they really seem to have had these sentiments:
as, in general, it is to be observed that the Platonic discrimination
and valuation of the "idea" in contrast to the "eidolon," the image,
is deeply rooted in the Hellenic being. Availing ourselves of Plato's
terminology, however, we should have to speak of the tragic figures of
the Hellenic stage somewhat as follows. The one truly real Dionysus
appears in a multiplicity of forms, in the mask of a fighting hero
and entangled, as it were, in the net of an individual will. As the
visibly appearing god now talks and acts, he resembles an erring,
striving, suffering individual: and that, in general, he _appears_
with such epic precision and clearness, is due to the dream-reading
Apollo, who reads to the chorus its Dionysian state through this
symbolic appearance. In reality, however, this hero is the suffering
Dionysus of the mysteries, a god experiencing in himself the sufferings
of individuation, of whom wonderful myths tell that as a boy he was
dismembered by the Titans and has been worshipped in this state
as Zagreus:[15] whereby is intimated that this dismemberment, the
properly Dionysian _suffering,_ is like a transformation into air,
water, earth, and fire, that we must therefore regard the state of
individuation as the source and primal cause of all suffering, as
something objectionable in itself. From the smile of this Dionysus
sprang the Olympian gods, from his tears sprang man. In his existence
as a dismembered god, Dionysus has the dual nature of a cruel
barbarised demon, and a mild pacific ruler. But the hope of the epopts
looked for a new birth of Dionysus, which we have now to conceive of in
anticipation as the end of individuation: it was for this coming third
Dionysus that the stormy jubilation-hymns of the epopts resounded. And
it is only this hope that sheds a ray of joy upon the features of a
world torn asunder and shattered into individuals: as is symbolised in
the myth by Demeter sunk in eternal sadness, who _rejoices_ again only
when told that she may _once more_ give birth to Dionysus In the views
of things here given we already have all the elements of a profound and
pessimistic contemplation of the world, and along with these we have
the _mystery doctrine of tragedy_: the fundamental knowledge of the
oneness of all existing things, the consideration of individuation as
the primal cause of evil, and art as the joyous hope that the spell of
individuation may be broken, as the augury of a restored oneness.

It has already been intimated that the Homeric epos is the poem
of Olympian culture, wherewith this culture has sung its own song
of triumph over the terrors of the war of the Titans. Under the
predominating influence of tragic poetry, these Homeric myths are now
reproduced anew, and show by this metempsychosis that meantime the
Olympian culture also has been vanquished by a still deeper view of
things. The haughty Titan Prometheus has announced to his Olympian
tormentor that the extremest danger will one day menace his rule,
unless he ally with him betimes. In Æschylus we perceive the terrified
Zeus, apprehensive of his end, in alliance with the Titan. Thus, the
former age of the Titans is subsequently brought from Tartarus once
more to the light of day. The philosophy of wild and naked nature
beholds with the undissembled mien of truth the myths of the Homeric
world as they dance past: they turn pale, they tremble before the
lightning glance of this goddess--till the powerful fist[16] of
the Dionysian artist forces them into the service of the new deity.
Dionysian truth takes over the entire domain of myth as symbolism of
_its_ knowledge, which it makes known partly in the public cult of
tragedy and partly in the secret celebration of the dramatic mysteries,
always, however, in the old mythical garb. What was the power, which
freed Prometheus from his vultures and transformed the myth into a
vehicle of Dionysian wisdom? It is the Heracleian power of music:
which, having reached its highest manifestness in tragedy, can invest
myths with a new and most profound significance, which we have already
had occasion to characterise as the most powerful faculty of music. For
it is the fate of every myth to insinuate itself into the narrow limits
of some alleged historical reality, and to be treated by some later
generation as a solitary fact with historical claims: and the Greeks
were already fairly on the way to restamp the whole of their mythical
juvenile dream sagaciously and arbitrarily into a historico-pragmatical
_juvenile history._ For this is the manner in which religions are
wont to die out: when of course under the stern, intelligent eyes of
an orthodox dogmatism, the mythical presuppositions of a religion are
systematised as a completed sum of historical events, and when one
begins apprehensively to defend the credibility of the myth, while at
the same time opposing all continuation of their natural vitality and
luxuriance; when, accordingly, the feeling for myth dies out, and its
place is taken by the claim of religion to historical foundations.
This dying myth was now seized by the new-born genius of Dionysian
music, in whose hands it bloomed once more, with such colours as it
had never yet displayed, with a fragrance that awakened a longing
anticipation of a metaphysical world. After this final effulgence
it collapses, its leaves wither, and soon the scoffing Lucians of
antiquity catch at the discoloured and faded flowers which the winds
carry off in every direction. Through tragedy the myth attains its
profoundest significance, its most expressive form; it rises once more
like a wounded hero, and the whole surplus of vitality, together with
the philosophical calmness of the Dying, burns in its eyes with a last
powerful gleam.

What meantest thou, oh impious Euripides, in seeking once more to
enthral this dying one? It died under thy ruthless hands: and then
thou madest use of counterfeit, masked myth, which like the ape of
Heracles could only trick itself out in the old finery. And as myth
died in thy hands, so also died the genius of music; though thou
couldst covetously plunder all the gardens of music--thou didst only
realise a counterfeit, masked music. And because thou hast forsaken
Dionysus. Apollo hath also forsaken thee; rout up all the passions from
their haunts and conjure them into thy sphere, sharpen and polish a
sophistical dialectics for the speeches of thy heroes--thy very heroes
have only counterfeit, masked passions, and speak only counterfeit,
masked music.

Greek tragedy had a fate different from that of all her older sister
arts: she died by suicide, in consequence of an irreconcilable
conflict; accordingly she died tragically, while they all passed away
very calmly and beautifully in ripe old age. For if it be in accordance
with a happy state of things to depart this life without a struggle,
leaving behind a fair posterity, the closing period of these older
arts exhibits such a happy state of things: slowly they sink out of
sight, and before their dying eyes already stand their fairer progeny,
who impatiently lift up their heads with courageous mien. The death of
Greek tragedy, on the other hand, left an immense void, deeply felt
everywhere. Even as certain Greek sailors in the time of Tiberius once
heard upon a lonesome island the thrilling cry, "great Pan is dead": so
now as it were sorrowful wailing sounded through the Hellenic world:
"Tragedy is dead! Poetry itself has perished with her! Begone, begone,
ye stunted, emaciated epigones! Begone to Hades, that ye may for once
eat your fill of the crumbs of your former masters!"

But when after all a new Art blossomed forth which revered tragedy as
her ancestress and mistress, it was observed with horror that she did
indeed bear the features of her mother, but those very features the
latter had exhibited in her long death-struggle. It was _Euripides_ who
fought this death-struggle of tragedy; the later art is known as the
_New Attic Comedy._ In it the degenerate form of tragedy lived on as a
monument of the most painful and violent death of tragedy proper.

This connection between the two serves to explain the passionate
attachment to Euripides evinced by the poets of the New Comedy, and
hence we are no longer surprised at the wish of Philemon, who would
have got himself hanged at once, with the sole design of being able
to visit Euripides in the lower regions: if only he could be assured
generally that the deceased still had his wits. But if we desire, as
briefly as possible, and without professing to say aught exhaustive on
the subject, to characterise what Euripides has in common with Menander
and Philemon, and what appealed to them so strongly as worthy of
imitation: it will suffice to say that the _spectator_ was brought upon
the stage by Euripides. He who has perceived the material of which the
Promethean tragic writers prior to Euripides formed their heroes, and
how remote from their purpose it was to bring the true mask of reality
on the stage, will also know what to make of the wholly divergent
tendency of Euripides. Through him the commonplace individual forced
his way from the spectators' benches to the stage itself; the mirror in
which formerly only great and bold traits found expression now showed
the painful exactness that conscientiously reproduces even the abortive
lines of nature. Odysseus, the typical Hellene of the Old Art, sank,
in the hands of the new poets, to the figure of the Græculus, who, as
the good-naturedly cunning domestic slave, stands henceforth in the
centre of dramatic interest. What Euripides takes credit for in the
Aristophanean "Frogs," namely, that by his household remedies he freed
tragic art from its pompous corpulency, is apparent above all in his
tragic heroes. The spectator now virtually saw and heard his double on
the Euripidean stage, and rejoiced that he could talk so well. But this
joy was not all: one even learned of Euripides how to speak: he prides
himself upon this in his contest with Æschylus: how the people have
learned from him how to observe, debate, and draw conclusions according
to the rules of art and with the cleverest sophistications. In general
it may be said that through this revolution of the popular language he
made the New Comedy possible. For it was henceforth no longer a secret,
how--and with what saws--the commonplace could represent and express
itself on the stage. Civic mediocrity, on which Euripides built all
his political hopes, was now suffered to speak, while heretofore the
demigod in tragedy and the drunken satyr, or demiman, in comedy, had
determined the character of the language. And so the Aristophanean
Euripides prides himself on having portrayed the common, familiar,
everyday life and dealings of the people, concerning which all are
qualified to pass judgment. If now the entire populace philosophises,
manages land and goods with unheard-of circumspection, and conducts
law-suits, he takes all the credit to himself, and glories in the
splendid results of the wisdom with which he inoculated the rabble.

It was to a populace prepared and enlightened in this manner that the
New Comedy could now address itself, of which Euripides had become
as it were the chorus-master; only that in this case the chorus of
spectators had to be trained. As soon as this chorus was trained to
sing in the Euripidean key, there arose that chesslike variety of the
drama, the New Comedy, with its perpetual triumphs of cunning and
artfulness. But Euripides--the chorus-master--was praised incessantly:
indeed, people would have killed themselves in order to learn yet more
from him, had they not known that tragic poets were quite as dead as
tragedy. But with it the Hellene had surrendered the belief in his
immortality; not only the belief in an ideal past, but also the belief
in an ideal future. The saying taken from the well-known epitaph, "as
an old man, frivolous and capricious," applies also to aged Hellenism.
The passing moment, wit, levity, and caprice, are its highest deities;
the fifth class, that of the slaves, now attains to power, at least in
sentiment: and if we can still speak at all of "Greek cheerfulness,"
it is the cheerfulness of the slave who has nothing of consequence to
answer for, nothing great to strive for, and cannot value anything of
the past or future higher than the present. It was this semblance of
"Greek cheerfulness" which so revolted the deep-minded and formidable
natures of the first four centuries of Christianity: this womanish
flight from earnestness and terror, this cowardly contentedness with
easy pleasure, was not only contemptible to them, but seemed to be a
specifically anti-Christian sentiment. And we must ascribe it to its
influence that the conception of Greek antiquity, which lived on for
centuries, preserved with almost enduring persistency that peculiar
hectic colour of cheerfulness--as if there had never been a Sixth
Century with its birth of tragedy, its Mysteries, its Pythagoras and
Heraclitus, indeed as if the art-works of that great period did not at
all exist, which in fact--each by itself--can in no wise be explained
as having sprung from the soil of such a decrepit and slavish love
of existence and cheerfulness, and point to an altogether different
conception of things as their source.

The assertion made a moment ago, that Euripides introduced the
spectator on the stage to qualify him the better to pass judgment on
the drama, will make it appear as if the old tragic art was always
in a false relation to the spectator: and one would be tempted to
extol the radical tendency of Euripides to bring about an adequate
relation between art-work and public as an advance on Sophocles. But,
as things are, "public" is merely a word, and not at all a homogeneous
and constant quantity. Why should the artist be under obligations to
accommodate himself to a power whose strength is merely in numbers?
And if by virtue of his endowments and aspirations he feels himself
superior to every one of these spectators, how could he feel greater
respect for the collective expression of all these subordinate
capacities than for the relatively highest-endowed individual
spectator? In truth, if ever a Greek artist treated his public
throughout a long life with presumptuousness and self-sufficiency,
it was Euripides, who, even when the masses threw themselves at his
feet, with sublime defiance made an open assault on his own tendency,
the very tendency with which he had triumphed over the masses. If this
genius had had the slightest reverence for the pandemonium of the
public, he would have broken down long before the middle of his career
beneath the weighty blows of his own failures. These considerations
here make it obvious that our formula--namely, that Euripides brought
the spectator upon the stage, in order to make him truly competent to
pass judgment--was but a provisional one, and that we must seek for a
deeper understanding of his tendency. Conversely, it is undoubtedly
well known that Æschylus and Sophocles, during all their lives, indeed,
far beyond their lives, enjoyed the full favour of the people, and that
therefore in the case of these predecessors of Euripides the idea of
a false relation between art-work and public was altogether excluded.
What was it that thus forcibly diverted this highly gifted artist, so
incessantly impelled to production, from the path over which shone the
sun of the greatest names in poetry and the cloudless heaven of popular
favour? What strange consideration for the spectator led him to defy,
the spectator? How could he, owing to too much respect for the public
--dis-respect the public?

Euripides--and this is the solution of the riddle just propounded--felt
himself, as a poet, undoubtedly superior to the masses, but not to
two of his spectators: he brought the masses upon the stage; these
two spectators he revered as the only competent judges and masters
of his art: in compliance with their directions and admonitions, he
transferred the entire world of sentiments, passions, and experiences,
hitherto present at every festival representation as the invisible
chorus on the spectators' benches, into the souls of his stage-heroes;
he yielded to their demands when he also sought for these new
characters the new word and the new tone; in their voices alone he
heard the conclusive verdict on his work, as also the cheering promise
of triumph when he found himself condemned as usual by the justice of
the public.

Of these two, spectators the one is--Euripides himself, Euripides _as
thinker,_ not as poet. It might be said of him, that his unusually
large fund of critical ability, as in the case of Lessing, if it did
not create, at least constantly fructified a productively artistic
collateral impulse. With this faculty, with all the clearness and
dexterity of his critical thought, Euripides had sat in the theatre and
striven to recognise in the masterpieces of his great predecessors, as
in faded paintings, feature and feature, line and line. And here had
happened to him what one initiated in the deeper arcana of Æschylean
tragedy must needs have expected: he observed something incommensurable
in every feature and in every line, a certain deceptive distinctness
and at the same time an enigmatic profundity, yea an infinitude, of
background. Even the clearest figure had always a comet's tail attached
to it, which seemed to suggest the uncertain and the inexplicable.
The same twilight shrouded the structure of the drama, especially the
significance of the chorus. And how doubtful seemed the solution of
the ethical problems to his mind! How questionable the treatment of
the myths! How unequal the distribution of happiness and misfortune!
Even in the language of the Old Tragedy there was much that was
objectionable to him, or at least enigmatical; he found especially
too much pomp for simple affairs, too many tropes and immense things
for the plainness of the characters. Thus he sat restlessly pondering
in the theatre, and as a spectator he acknowledged to himself that he
did not understand his great predecessors. If, however, he thought the
understanding the root proper of all enjoyment and productivity, he had
to inquire and look about to see whether any one else thought as he
did, and also acknowledged this incommensurability. But most people,
and among them the best individuals, had only a distrustful smile for
him, while none could explain why the great masters were still in the
right in face of his scruples and objections. And in this painful
condition he found _that other spectator,_ who did not comprehend,
and therefore did not esteem, tragedy. In alliance with him he could
venture, from amid his lonesomeness, to begin the prodigious struggle
against the art of Æschylus and Sophocles--not with polemic writings,
but as a dramatic poet, who opposed _his own_ conception of tragedy to
the traditional one.



12.


Before we name this other spectator, let us pause here a moment in
order to recall our own impression, as previously described, of the
discordant and incommensurable elements in the nature of Æschylean
tragedy. Let us think of our own astonishment at the _chorus_ and
the _tragic hero_ of that type of tragedy, neither of which we could
reconcile with our practices any more than with tradition--till we
rediscovered this duplexity itself as the origin and essence of Greek
tragedy, as the expression of two interwoven artistic impulses, _the
Apollonian and the Dionysian_.

To separate this primitive and all-powerful Dionysian element from
tragedy, and to build up a new and purified form of tragedy on the
basis of a non-Dionysian art, morality, and conception of things--such
is the tendency of Euripides which now reveals itself to us in a clear
light.

In a myth composed in the eve of his life, Euripides himself most
urgently propounded to his contemporaries the question as to the
value and signification of this tendency. Is the Dionysian entitled
to exist at all? Should it not be forcibly rooted out of the Hellenic
soil? Certainly, the poet tells us, if only it were possible: but the
god Dionysus is too powerful; his most intelligent adversary--like
Pentheus in the "Bacchæ"--is unwittingly enchanted by him, and
in this enchantment meets his fate. The judgment of the two old
sages, Cadmus and Tiresias, seems to be also the judgment of the
aged poet: that the reflection of the wisest individuals does not
overthrow old popular traditions, nor the perpetually propagating
worship of Dionysus, that in fact it behoves us to display at least a
diplomatically cautious concern in the presence of such strange forces:
where however it is always possible that the god may take offence
at such lukewarm participation, and finally change the diplomat--in
this case Cadmus--into a dragon. This is what a poet tells us, who
opposed Dionysus with heroic valour throughout a long life--in order
finally to wind up his career with a glorification of his adversary,
and with suicide, like one staggering from giddiness, who, in order
to escape the horrible vertigo he can no longer endure, casts himself
from a tower. This tragedy--the Bacchæ--is a protest against the
practicability of his own tendency; alas, and it has already been
put into practice! The surprising thing had happened: when the poet
recanted, his tendency had already conquered. Dionysus had already
been scared from the tragic stage, and in fact by a demonic power
which spoke through Euripides. Even Euripides was, in a certain sense,
only a mask: the deity that spoke through him was neither Dionysus nor
Apollo, but an altogether new-born demon, called _Socrates._ This is
the new antithesis: the Dionysian and the Socratic, and the art-work of
Greek tragedy was wrecked on it. What if even Euripides now seeks to
comfort us by his recantation? It is of no avail: the most magnificent
temple lies in ruins. What avails the lamentation of the destroyer,
and his confession that it was the most beautiful of all temples? And
even that Euripides has been changed into a dragon as a punishment by
the art-critics of all ages--who could be content with this wretched
compensation?

Let us now approach this _Socratic_ tendency with which Euripides
combated and vanquished Æschylean tragedy.

We must now ask ourselves, what could be the ulterior aim of the
Euripidean design, which, in the highest ideality of its execution,
would found drama exclusively on the non-Dionysian? What other form of
drama could there be, if it was not to be born of the womb of music, in
the mysterious twilight of the Dionysian? Only _the dramatised epos:_
in which Apollonian domain of art the _tragic_ effect is of course
unattainable. It does not depend on the subject-matter of the events
here represented; indeed, I venture to assert that it would have been
impossible for Goethe in his projected "Nausikaa" to have rendered
tragically effective the suicide of the idyllic being with which he
intended to complete the fifth act; so extraordinary is the power of
the epic-Apollonian representation, that it charms, before our eyes,
the most terrible things by the joy in appearance and in redemption
through appearance. The poet of the dramatised epos cannot completely
blend with his pictures any more than the epic rhapsodist. He is still
just the calm, unmoved embodiment of Contemplation whose wide eyes see
the picture _before_ them. The actor in this dramatised epos still
remains intrinsically rhapsodist: the consecration of inner dreaming
is on all his actions, so that he is never wholly an actor.

How, then, is the Euripidean play related to this ideal of the
Apollonian drama? Just as the younger rhapsodist is related to the
solemn rhapsodist of the old time. The former describes his own
character in the Platonic "Ion" as follows: "When I am saying anything
sad, my eyes fill with tears; when, however, what I am saying is awful
and terrible, then my hair stands on end through fear, and my heart
leaps." Here we no longer observe anything of the epic absorption
in appearance, or of the unemotional coolness of the true actor,
who precisely in his highest activity is wholly appearance and joy
in appearance. Euripides is the actor with leaping heart, with hair
standing on end; as Socratic thinker he designs the plan, as passionate
actor he executes it. Neither in the designing nor in the execution is
he an artist pure and simple. And so the Euripidean drama is a thing
both cool and fiery, equally capable of freezing and burning; it is
impossible for it to attain the Apollonian, effect of the epos, while,
on the other hand, it has severed itself as much as possible from
Dionysian elements, and now, in order to act at all, it requires new
stimulants, which can no longer lie within the sphere of the two unique
art-impulses, the Apollonian and the Dionysian. The stimulants are
cool, paradoxical _thoughts_, in place of Apollonian intuitions--and
fiery _passions_--in place Dionysean ecstasies; and in fact, thoughts
and passions very realistically copied, and not at all steeped in the
ether of art.

Accordingly, if we have perceived this much, that Euripides did not
succeed in establishing the drama exclusively on the Apollonian, but
that rather his non-Dionysian inclinations deviated into a naturalistic
and inartistic tendency, we shall now be able to approach nearer to
the character _æsthetic Socratism._ supreme law of which reads about
as follows: "to be beautiful everything must be intelligible," as
the parallel to the Socratic proposition, "only the knowing is one
virtuous." With this canon in his hands Euripides measured all the
separate elements of the drama, and rectified them according to his
principle: the language, the characters, the dramaturgic structure, and
the choric music. The poetic deficiency and retrogression, which we
are so often wont to impute to Euripides in comparison with Sophoclean
tragedy, is for the most part the product of this penetrating critical
process, this daring intelligibility. The Euripidian _prologue_ may
serve us as an example of the productivity of this, rationalistic
method. Nothing could be more opposed to the technique of our stage
than the prologue in the drama of Euripides. For a single person to
appear at the outset of the play telling us who he is, what precedes
the action, what has happened thus far, yea, what will happen in
the course of the play, would be designated by a modern playwright
as a wanton and unpardonable abandonment of the effect of suspense.
Everything that is about to happen is known beforehand; who then
cares to wait for it actually to happen?--considering, moreover, that
here there is not by any means the exciting relation of a predicting
dream to a reality taking place later on. Euripides speculated quite
differently. The effect of tragedy never depended on epic suspense, on
the fascinating uncertainty as to what is to happen now and afterwards:
but rather on the great rhetoro-lyric scenes in which the passion and
dialectics of the chief hero swelled to a broad and mighty stream.
Everything was arranged for pathos, not for action: and whatever
was not arranged for pathos was regarded as objectionable. But what
interferes most with the hearer's pleasurable satisfaction in such
scenes is a missing link, a gap in the texture of the previous history.
So long as the spectator has to divine the meaning of this or that
person, or the presuppositions of this or that conflict of inclinations
and intentions, his complete absorption in the doings and sufferings
of the chief persons is impossible, as is likewise breathless
fellow-feeling and fellow-fearing. The Æschyleo-Sophoclean tragedy
employed the most ingenious devices in the first scenes to place in
the hands of the spectator as if by chance all the threads requisite
for understanding the whole: a trait in which that noble artistry is
approved, which as it were masks the _inevitably_ formal, and causes
it to appear as something accidental. But nevertheless Euripides
thought he observed that during these first scenes the spectator was
in a strange state of anxiety to make out the problem of the previous
history, so that the poetic beauties and pathos of the exposition
were lost to him. Accordingly he placed the prologue even before the
exposition, and put it in the mouth of a person who could be trusted:
some deity had often as it were to guarantee the particulars of the
tragedy to the public and remove every doubt as to the reality of the
myth: as in the case of Descartes, who could only prove the reality
of the empiric world by an appeal to the truthfulness of God and His
inability to utter falsehood. Euripides makes use of the same divine
truthfulness once more at the close of his drama, in order to ensure to
the public the future of his heroes; this is the task of the notorious
_deus ex machina._ Between the preliminary and the additional epic
spectacle there is the dramatico-lyric present, the "drama" proper.

Thus Euripides as a poet echoes above all his own conscious
knowledge; and it is precisely on this account that he occupies such
a notable position in the history of Greek art. With reference to his
critico-productive activity, he must often have felt that he ought
to actualise in the drama the words at the beginning of the essay of
Anaxagoras: "In the beginning all things were mixed together; then
came the understanding and created order." And if Anaxagoras with his
"νοῡς" seemed like the first sober person among nothing but drunken
philosophers, Euripides may also have conceived his relation to
the other tragic poets under a similar figure. As long as the sole
ruler and disposer of the universe, the νοῡς, was still excluded
from artistic activity, things were all mixed together in a chaotic,
primitive mess;--it is thus Euripides was obliged to think, it is thus
he was obliged to condemn the "drunken" poets as the first "sober" one
among them. What Sophocles said of Æschylus, that he did what was
right, though unconsciously, was surely not in the mind of Euripides:
who would have admitted only thus much, that Æschylus, _because_ he
wrought unconsciously, did what was wrong. So also the divine Plato
speaks for the most part only ironically of the creative faculty of the
poet, in so far as it is not conscious insight, and places it on a par
with the gift of the soothsayer and dream-interpreter; insinuating that
the poet is incapable of composing until he has become unconscious and
reason has deserted him. Like Plato, Euripides undertook to show to the
world the reverse of the "unintelligent" poet; his æsthetic principle
that "to be beautiful everything must be known" is, as I have said,
the parallel to the Socratic "to be good everything must be known."
Accordingly we may regard Euripides as the poet of æsthetic Socratism.
Socrates, however, was that _second spectator_ who did not comprehend
and therefore did not esteem the Old Tragedy; in alliance with him
Euripides ventured to be the herald of a new artistic activity. If,
then, the Old Tragedy was here destroyed, it follows that æsthetic
Socratism was the murderous principle; but in so far as the struggle is
directed against the Dionysian element in the old art, we recognise in
Socrates the opponent of Dionysus, the new Orpheus who rebels against
Dionysus; and although destined to be torn to pieces by the Mænads of
the Athenian court, yet puts to flight the overpowerful god himself,
who, when he fled from Lycurgus, the king of Edoni, sought refuge in
the depths of the ocean--namely, in the mystical flood of a secret
cult which gradually overspread the earth.



13.


That Socrates stood in close relationship to Euripides in the tendency
of his teaching, did not escape the notice of contemporaneous
antiquity; the most eloquent expression of this felicitous insight
being the tale current in Athens, that Socrates was accustomed to help
Euripides in poetising. Both names were mentioned in one breath by the
adherents of the "good old time," whenever they came to enumerating the
popular agitators of the day: to whose influence they attributed the
fact that the old Marathonian stalwart capacity of body and soul was
more and more being sacrificed to a dubious enlightenment, involving
progressive degeneration of the physical and mental powers. It is in
this tone, half indignantly and half contemptuously, that Aristophanic
comedy is wont to speak of both of them--to the consternation of
modern men, who would indeed be willing enough to give up Euripides,
but cannot suppress their amazement that Socrates should appear in
Aristophanes as the first and head _sophist,_ as the mirror and epitome
of all sophistical tendencies; in connection with which it offers the
single consolation of putting Aristophanes himself in the pillory, as a
rakish, lying Alcibiades of poetry. Without here defending the profound
instincts of Aristophanes against such attacks, I shall now indicate,
by means of the sentiments of the time, the close connection between
Socrates and Euripides. With this purpose in view, it is especially to
be remembered that Socrates, as an opponent of tragic art, did not
ordinarily patronise tragedy, but only appeared among the spectators
when a new play of Euripides was performed. The most noted thing,
however, is the close juxtaposition of the two names in the Delphic
oracle, which designated Socrates as the wisest of men, but at the same
time decided that the second prize in the contest of wisdom was due to
Euripides.

Sophocles was designated as the third in this scale of rank; he who
could pride himself that, in comparison with Æschylus, he did what
was right, and did it, moreover, because he _knew_ what was right. It
is evidently just the degree of clearness of this _knowledge,_ which
distinguishes these three men in common as the three "knowing ones" of
their age.

The most decisive word, however, for this new and unprecedented
esteem of knowledge and insight was spoken by Socrates when he
found that he was the only one who acknowledged to himself that he
_knew nothing_ while in his critical pilgrimage through Athens, and
calling on the greatest statesmen, orators, poets, and artists, he
discovered everywhere the conceit of knowledge. He perceived, to his
astonishment, that all these celebrities were without a proper and
accurate insight, even with regard to their own callings, and practised
them only by instinct. "Only by instinct": with this phrase we touch
upon the heart and core of the Socratic tendency. Socratism condemns
therewith existing art as well as existing ethics; wherever Socratism
turns its searching eyes it beholds the lack of insight and the
power of illusion; and from this lack infers the inner perversity and
objectionableness of existing conditions. From this point onwards,
Socrates believed that he was called upon to, correct existence;
and, with an air of disregard and superiority, as the precursor
of an altogether different culture, art, and morality, he enters
single-handed into a world, of which, if we reverently touched the hem,
we should count it our greatest happiness.

Here is the extraordinary hesitancy which always seizes upon us with
regard to Socrates, and again and again invites us to ascertain the
sense and purpose of this most questionable phenomenon of antiquity.
Who is it that ventures single-handed to disown the Greek character,
which, as Homer, Pindar, and Æschylus, as Phidias, as Pericles, as
Pythia and Dionysus, as the deepest abyss and the highest height, is
sure of our wondering admiration? What demoniac power is it which would
presume to spill this magic draught in the dust? What demigod is it to
whom the chorus of spirits of the noblest of mankind must call out:
"Weh! Weh! Du hast sie zerstört, die schöne Welt, mit mächtiger Faust;
sie stürzt, sie zerfällt!"[17]

A key to the character of Socrates is presented to us by the surprising
phenomenon designated as the "daimonion" of Socrates. In special
circumstances, when his gigantic intellect began to stagger, he got
a secure support in the utterances of a divine voice which then
spake to him. This voice, whenever it comes, always _dissuades._
In this totally abnormal nature instinctive wisdom only appears in
order to hinder the progress of conscious perception here and there.
While in all productive men it is instinct which is the creatively
affirmative force, consciousness only comporting itself critically
and dissuasively; with Socrates it is instinct which becomes critic;
it is consciousness which becomes creator--a perfect monstrosity
_per defectum!_ And we do indeed observe here a monstrous _defectus_
of all mystical aptitude, so that Socrates might be designated as
the specific _non-mystic,_ in whom the logical nature is developed,
through a superfoetation, to the same excess as instinctive wisdom
is developed in the mystic. On the other hand, however, the logical
instinct which appeared in Socrates was absolutely prohibited from
turning against itself; in its unchecked flow it manifests a native
power such as we meet with, to our shocking surprise, only among the
very greatest instinctive forces. He who has experienced even a breath
of the divine naïveté and security of the Socratic course of life in
the Platonic writings, will also feel that the enormous driving-wheel
of logical Socratism is in motion, as it were, _behind_ Socrates, and
that it must be viewed through Socrates as through a shadow. And
that he himself had a boding of this relation is apparent from the
dignified earnestness with which he everywhere, and even before his
judges, insisted on his divine calling. To refute him here was really
as impossible as to approve of his instinct-disintegrating influence.
In view of this indissoluble conflict, when he had at last been brought
before the forum of the Greek state, there was only one punishment
demanded, namely exile; he might have been sped across the borders as
something thoroughly enigmatical, irrubricable and inexplicable, and so
posterity would have been quite unjustified in charging the Athenians
with a deed of ignominy. But that the sentence of death, and not mere
exile, was pronounced upon him, seems to have been brought about by
Socrates himself, with perfect knowledge of the circumstances, and
without the natural fear of death: he met his death with the calmness
with which, according to the description of Plato, he leaves the
symposium at break of day, as the last of the revellers, to begin a new
day; while the sleepy companions remain behind on the benches and the
floor, to dream of Socrates, the true eroticist. _The dying Socrates_
became the new ideal of the noble Greek youths,--an ideal they had
never yet beheld,--and above all, the typical Hellenic youth, Plato,
prostrated himself before this scene with all the fervent devotion of
his visionary soul.

Let us now imagine the one great Cyclopean eye of Socrates fixed on
tragedy, that eye in which the fine frenzy of artistic enthusiasm had
never glowed--let us think how it was denied to this eye to gaze with
pleasure into the Dionysian abysses--what could it not but see in the
"sublime and greatly lauded" tragic art, as Plato called it? Something
very absurd, with causes that seemed to be without effects, and
effects apparently without causes; the whole, moreover, so motley and
diversified that it could not but be repugnant to a thoughtful mind, a
dangerous incentive, however, to sensitive and irritable souls. We know
what was the sole kind of poetry which he comprehended: the _Æsopian
fable_: and he did this no doubt with that smiling complaisance with
which the good honest Gellert sings the praise of poetry in the fable
of the bee and the hen:--

    "Du siehst an mir, wozu sie nützt,
    Dem, der nicht viel Verstand besitzt,
    Die Wahrheit durch ein Bild zu sagen."[18]

But then it seemed to Socrates that tragic art did not even "tell the
truth": not to mention the fact that it addresses itself to him who
"hath but little wit"; consequently not to the philosopher: a twofold
reason why it should be avoided. Like Plato, he reckoned it among the
seductive arts which only represent the agreeable, not the useful, and
hence he required of his disciples abstinence and strict separation
from such unphilosophical allurements; with such success that the
youthful tragic poet Plato first of all burned his poems to be able to
become a scholar of Socrates. But where unconquerable native capacities
bore up against the Socratic maxims, their power, together with the
momentum of his mighty character, still sufficed to force poetry itself
into new and hitherto unknown channels.

An instance of this is the aforesaid Plato: he, who in the condemnation
of tragedy and of art in general certainly did not fall short of
the naïve cynicism of his master, was nevertheless constrained by
sheer artistic necessity to create a form of art which is inwardly
related even to the then existing forms of art which he repudiated.
Plato's main objection to the old art--that it is the imitation of
a phantom,[19] and hence belongs to a sphere still lower than the
empiric world--could not at all apply to the new art: and so we find
Plato endeavouring to go beyond reality and attempting to represent
the idea which underlies this pseudo-reality. But Plato, the thinker,
thereby arrived by a roundabout road just at the point where he had
always been at home as poet, and from which Sophocles and all the old
artists had solemnly protested against that objection. If tragedy
absorbed into itself all the earlier varieties of art, the same
could again be said in an unusual sense of Platonic dialogue, which,
engendered by a mixture of all the then existing forms and styles,
hovers midway between narrative, lyric and drama, between prose and
poetry, and has also thereby broken loose from the older strict law
of unity of linguistic form; a movement which was carried still
farther by the _cynic_ writers, who in the most promiscuous style,
oscillating to and fro betwixt prose and metrical forms, realised also
the literary picture of the "raving Socrates" whom they were wont to
represent in life. Platonic dialogue was as it were the boat in which
the shipwrecked ancient poetry saved herself together with all her
children: crowded into a narrow space and timidly obsequious to the
one steersman, Socrates, they now launched into a new world, which
never tired of looking at the fantastic spectacle of this procession.
In very truth, Plato has given to all posterity the prototype of a new
form of art, the prototype of the _novel_ which must be designated as
the infinitely evolved Æsopian fable, in which poetry holds the same
rank with reference to dialectic philosophy as this same philosophy
held for many centuries with reference to theology: namely, the rank of
_ancilla._ This was the new position of poetry into which Plato forced
it under the pressure of the demon-inspired Socrates.

Here _philosophic thought_ overgrows art and compels it to cling close
to the trunk of dialectics. The _Apollonian_ tendency has chrysalised
in the logical schematism; just as something analogous in the case
of Euripides (and moreover a translation of the _Dionysian_ into the
naturalistic emotion) was forced upon our attention. Socrates, the
dialectical hero in Platonic drama, reminds us of the kindred nature
of the Euripidean hero, who has to defend his actions by arguments and
counter-arguments, and thereby so often runs the risk of forfeiting
our tragic pity; for who could mistake the _optimistic_ element
in the essence of dialectics, which celebrates a jubilee in every
conclusion, and can breathe only in cool clearness and consciousness:
the optimistic element, which, having once forced its way into tragedy,
must gradually overgrow its Dionysian regions, and necessarily impel it
to self-destruction--even to the death-leap into the bourgeois drama.
Let us but realise the consequences of the Socratic maxims: "Virtue is
knowledge; man only sins from ignorance; he who is virtuous is happy":
these three fundamental forms of optimism involve the death of tragedy.
For the virtuous hero must now be a dialectician; there must now be a
necessary, visible connection between virtue and knowledge, between
belief and morality; the transcendental justice of the plot in Æschylus
is now degraded to the superficial and audacious principle of poetic
justice with its usual _deus ex machina_.

How does the _chorus,_ and, in general, the entire Dionyso-musical
substratum of tragedy, now appear in the light of this new
Socrato-optimistic stage-world? As something accidental, as a readily
dispensable reminiscence of the origin of tragedy; while we have
in fact seen that the chorus can be understood only as the cause of
tragedy, and of the tragic generally. This perplexity with respect to
the chorus first manifests itself in Sophocles--an important sign that
the Dionysian basis of tragedy already begins to disintegrate with
him. He no longer ventures to entrust to the chorus the main share
of the effect, but limits its sphere to such an extent that it now
appears almost co-ordinate with the actors, just as if it were elevated
from the orchestra into the scene: whereby of course its character
is completely destroyed, notwithstanding that Aristotle countenances
this very theory of the chorus. This alteration of the position of
the chorus, which Sophocles at any rate recommended by his practice,
and, according to tradition, even by a treatise, is the first step
towards the _annihilation_ of the chorus, the phases of which follow
one another with alarming rapidity in Euripides, Agathon, and the New
Comedy. Optimistic dialectics drives, _music_ out of tragedy with the
scourge of its syllogisms: that is, it destroys the essence of tragedy,
which can be explained only as a manifestation and illustration of
Dionysian states, as the visible symbolisation of music, as the
dream-world of Dionysian ecstasy.

If, therefore, we are to assume an anti-Dionysian tendency operating
even before Socrates, which received in him only an unprecedentedly
grand expression, we must not shrink from the question as to what
a phenomenon like that of Socrates indicates: whom in view of the
Platonic dialogues we are certainly not entitled to regard as a purely
disintegrating, negative power. And though there can be no doubt
whatever that the most immediate effect of the Socratic impulse tended
to the dissolution of Dionysian tragedy, yet a profound experience of
Socrates' own life compels us to ask whether there is _necessarily_
only an antipodal relation between Socratism and art, and whether the
birth of an "artistic Socrates" is in general something contradictory
in itself.

For that despotic logician had now and then the feeling of a gap, or
void, a sentiment of semi-reproach, as of a possibly neglected duty
with respect to art. There often came to him, as he tells his friends
in prison, one and the same dream-apparition, which kept constantly
repeating to him: "Socrates, practise music." Up to his very last days
he solaces himself with the opinion that his philosophising is the
highest form of poetry, and finds it hard to believe that a deity will
remind him of the "common, popular music." Finally, when in prison,
he consents to practise also this despised music, in order thoroughly
to unburden his conscience. And in this frame of mind he composes
a poem on Apollo and turns a few Æsopian fables into verse. It was
something similar to the demonian warning voice which urged him to
these practices; it was because of his Apollonian insight that, like a
barbaric king, he did not understand the noble image of a god and was
in danger of sinning against a deity--through ignorance. The prompting
voice of the Socratic dream-vision is the only sign of doubtfulness
as to the limits of logical nature. "Perhaps "--thus he had to ask
himself--"what is not intelligible to me is not therefore unreasonable?
Perhaps there is a realm of wisdom from which the logician is banished?
Perhaps art is even a necessary correlative of and supplement to
science?"

In the sense of these last portentous questions it must now be
indicated how the influence of Socrates (extending to the present
moment, indeed, to all futurity) has spread over posterity like an
ever-increasing shadow in the evening sun, and how this influence
again and again necessitates a regeneration of _art,_--yea, of art
already with metaphysical, broadest and profoundest sense,--and its own
eternity guarantees also the eternity of art.

Before this could be perceived, before the intrinsic dependence of
every art on the Greeks, the Greeks from Homer to Socrates, was
conclusively demonstrated, it had to happen to us with regard to these
Greeks as it happened to the Athenians with regard to Socrates. Nearly
every age and stage of culture has at some time or other sought with
deep displeasure to free itself from the Greeks, because in their
presence everything self-achieved, sincerely admired and apparently
quite original, seemed all of a sudden to lose life and colour
and shrink to an abortive copy, even to caricature. And so hearty
indignation breaks forth time after time against this presumptuous
little nation, which dared to designate as "barbaric" for all time
everything not native: who are they, one asks one's self, who, though
they possessed only an ephemeral historical splendour, ridiculously
restricted institutions, a dubious excellence in their customs, and
were even branded with ugly vices, yet lay claim to the dignity and
singular position among the peoples to which genius is entitled among
the masses. What a pity one has not been so fortunate as to find the
cup of hemlock with which such an affair could be disposed of without
ado: for all the poison which envy, calumny, and rankling resentment
engendered within themselves have not sufficed to destroy that
self-sufficient grandeur! And so one feels ashamed and afraid in the
presence of the Greeks: unless one prize truth above all things, and
dare also to acknowledge to one's self this truth, that the Greeks,
as charioteers, hold in their hands the reins of our own and of
every culture, but that almost always chariot and horses are of too
poor material and incommensurate with the glory of their guides, who
then will deem it sport to run such a team into an abyss: which they
themselves clear with the leap of Achilles.

In order to assign also to Socrates the dignity of such a leading
position, it will suffice to recognise in him the type of an unheard-of
form of existence, the type of the _theoretical man,_ with regard
to whose meaning and purpose it will be our next task to attain
an insight. Like the artist, the theorist also finds an infinite
satisfaction in what _is_ and, like the former, he is shielded by this
satisfaction from the practical ethics of pessimism with its lynx eyes
which shine only in the dark. For if the artist in every unveiling
of truth always cleaves with raptured eyes only to that which still
remains veiled after the unveiling, the theoretical man, on the other
hand, enjoys and contents himself with the cast-off veil, and finds
the consummation of his pleasure in the process of a continuously
successful unveiling through his own unaided efforts. There would
have been no science if it had only been concerned about that _one_
naked goddess and nothing else. For then its disciples would have been
obliged to feel like those who purposed to dig a hole straight through
the earth: each one of whom perceives that with the utmost lifelong
exertion he is able to excavate only a very little of the enormous
depth, which is again filled up before his eyes by the labours of his
successor, so that a third man seems to do well when on his own account
he selects a new spot for his attempts at tunnelling. If now some one
proves conclusively that the antipodal goal cannot be attained in this
direct way, who will still care to toil on in the old depths, unless he
has learned to content himself in the meantime with finding precious
stones or discovering natural laws? For that reason Lessing, the most
honest theoretical man, ventured to say that he cared more for the
search after truth than for truth itself: in saying which he revealed
the fundamental secret of science, to the astonishment, and indeed,
to the vexation of scientific men. Well, to be sure, there stands
alongside of this detached perception, as an excess of honesty, if not
of presumption, a profound _illusion_ which first came to the world
in the person of Socrates, the imperturbable belief that, by means
of the clue of causality, thinking reaches to the deepest abysses of
being, and that thinking is able not only to perceive being but even
to _correct_ it. This sublime metaphysical illusion is added as an
instinct to science and again and again leads the latter to its limits,
where it must change into _art; which is really the end, to be attained
by this mechanism_.

If we now look at Socrates in the light of this thought, he appears to
us as the first who could not only live, but--what is far more--also
die under the guidance of this instinct of science: and hence the
picture of the _dying, Socrates_, as the man delivered from the fear of
death by knowledge and argument, is the escutcheon, above the entrance
to science which reminds every one of its mission, namely, to make
existence appear to be comprehensible, and therefore to be justified:
for which purpose, if arguments do not suffice, _myth_ also must be
used, which I just now designated even as the necessary consequence,
yea, as the end of science.

He who once makes intelligible to himself how, after the death of
Socrates, the mystagogue of science, one philosophical school succeeds
another, like wave upon wave,--how an entirely unfore-shadowed
universal development of the thirst for knowledge in the widest
compass of the cultured world (and as the specific task for every
one highly gifted) led science on to the high sea from which since
then it has never again been able to be completely ousted; how
through the universality of this movement a common net of thought
was first stretched over the entire globe, with prospects, moreover,
of conformity to law in an entire solar system;--he who realises all
this, together with the amazingly high pyramid of our present-day
knowledge, cannot fail to see in Socrates the turning-point and vortex
of so-called universal history. For if one were to imagine the whole
incalculable sum of energy which has been used up by that universal
tendency,--employed, _not_ in the service of knowledge, but for the
practical, _i.e.,_ egoistical ends of individuals and peoples,--then
probably the instinctive love of life would be so much weakened in
universal wars of destruction and incessant migrations of peoples,
that, owing to the practice of suicide, the individual would perhaps
feel the last remnant of a sense of duty, when, like the native of
the Fiji Islands, as son he strangles his parents and, as friend, his
friend: a practical pessimism which might even give rise to a horrible
ethics of general slaughter out of pity--which, for the rest, exists
and has existed wherever art in one form or another, especially as
science and religion, has not appeared as a remedy and preventive of
that pestilential breath.

In view of this practical pessimism, Socrates is the archetype of
the theoretical optimist, who in the above-indicated belief in the
fathomableness of the nature of things, attributes to knowledge and
perception the power of a universal medicine, and sees in error and
evil. To penetrate into the depths of the nature of things, and to
separate true perception from error and illusion, appeared to the
Socratic man the noblest and even the only truly human calling: just as
from the time of Socrates onwards the mechanism of concepts, judgments,
and inferences was prized above all other capacities as the highest
activity and the most admirable gift of nature. Even the sublimest
moral acts, the stirrings of pity, of self-sacrifice, of heroism,
and that tranquillity of soul, so difficult of attainment, which the
Apollonian Greek called Sophrosyne, were derived by Socrates, and his
like-minded successors up to the present day, from the dialectics of
knowledge, and were accordingly designated as teachable. He who has
experienced in himself the joy of a Socratic perception, and felt how
it seeks to embrace, in constantly widening circles, the entire world
of phenomena, will thenceforth find no stimulus which could urge him
to existence more forcible than the desire to complete that conquest
and to knit the net impenetrably close. To a person thus minded the
Platonic Socrates then appears as the teacher of an entirely new form
of "Greek cheerfulness" and felicity of existence, which seeks to
discharge itself in actions, and will find its discharge for the most
part in maieutic and pedagogic influences on noble youths, with a view
to the ultimate production of genius.

But now science, spurred on by its powerful illusion, hastens
irresistibly to its limits, on which its optimism, hidden in the
essence of logic, is wrecked. For the periphery of the circle of
science has an infinite number of points, and while there is still no
telling how this circle can ever be completely measured, yet the noble
and gifted man, even before the middle of his career, inevitably comes
into contact with those extreme points of the periphery where he stares
at the inexplicable. When he here sees to his dismay how logic coils
round itself at these limits and finally bites its own tail--then the
new form of perception discloses itself, namely _tragic perception,_
which, in order even to be endured, requires art as a safeguard and
remedy.

If, with eyes strengthened and refreshed at the sight of the Greeks, we
look upon the highest spheres of the world that surrounds us, we behold
the avidity of the insatiate optimistic knowledge, of which Socrates is
the typical representative, transformed into tragic resignation and the
need of art: while, to be sure, this same avidity, in its lower stages,
has to exhibit itself as antagonistic to art, and must especially have
an inward detestation of Dionyso-tragic art, as was exemplified in the
opposition of Socratism to Æschylean tragedy.

Here then with agitated spirit we knock at the gates of the present and
the future: will that "transforming" lead to ever new configurations
of genius, and especially of the _music-practising Socrates_? Will the
net of art which is spread over existence, whether under the name of
religion or of science, be knit always more closely and delicately,
or is it destined to be torn to shreds under the restlessly barbaric
activity and whirl which is called "the present day"?--Anxious, yet
not disconsolate, we stand aloof for a little while, as the spectators
who are permitted to be witnesses of these tremendous struggles and
transitions. Alas! It is the charm of these struggles that he who
beholds them must also fight them!



16.


By this elaborate historical example we have endeavoured to make it
clear that tragedy perishes as surely by evanescence of the spirit of
music as it can be born only out of this spirit. In order to qualify
the singularity of this assertion, and, on the other hand, to disclose
the source of this insight of ours, we must now confront with clear
vision the analogous phenomena of the present time; we must enter
into the midst of these struggles, which, as I said just now, are
being carried on in the highest spheres of our present world between
the insatiate optimistic perception and the tragic need of art. In
so doing I shall leave out of consideration all other antagonistic
tendencies which at all times oppose art, especially tragedy, and which
at present again extend their sway triumphantly, to such an extent that
of the theatrical arts only the farce and the ballet, for example, put
forth their blossoms, which perhaps not every one cares to smell, in
tolerably rich luxuriance. I will speak only of the _Most Illustrious
Opposition_ to the tragic conception of things--and by this I mean
essentially optimistic science, with its ancestor Socrates at the head
of it. Presently also the forces will be designated which seem to me
to guarantee _a re-birth of tragedy_--and who knows what other blessed
hopes for the German genius!

Before we plunge into the midst of these struggles, let us array
ourselves in the armour of our hitherto acquired knowledge. In
contrast to all those who are intent on deriving the arts from one
exclusive principle, as the necessary vital source of every work of
art, I keep my eyes fixed on the two artistic deities of the Greeks,
Apollo and Dionysus, and recognise in them the living and conspicuous
representatives of _two_ worlds of art which differ in their intrinsic
essence and in their highest aims. Apollo stands before me as the
transfiguring genius of the _principium individuationis_ through
which alone the redemption in appearance is to be truly attained,
while by the mystical cheer of Dionysus the spell of individuation
is broken, and the way lies open to the Mothers of Being,[20] to the
innermost heart of things. This extraordinary antithesis, which opens
up yawningly between plastic art as the Apollonian and music as the
Dionysian art, has become manifest to only one of the great thinkers,
to such an extent that, even without this key to the symbolism of the
Hellenic divinities, he allowed to music a different character and
origin in advance of all the other arts, because, unlike them, it is
not a copy of the phenomenon, but a direct copy of the will itself, and
therefore represents _the metaphysical of everything physical in the
world_, the thing-in-itself of every phenomenon. (Schopenhauer, _Welt
als Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. 310.) To this most important perception
of æsthetics (with which, taken in a serious sense, æsthetics properly
commences), Richard Wagner, by way of confirmation of its eternal
truth, affixed his seal, when he asserted in his _Beethoven_ that
music must be judged according to æsthetic principles quite different
from those which apply to the plastic arts, and not, in general,
according to the category of beauty: although an erroneous æsthetics,
inspired by a misled and degenerate art, has by virtue of the concept
of beauty prevailing in the plastic domain accustomed itself to demand
of music an effect analogous to that of the works of plastic art,
namely the suscitating _delight in beautiful forms._ Upon perceiving
this extraordinary antithesis, I felt a strong inducement to approach
the essence of Greek tragedy, and, by means of it, the profoundest
revelation of Hellenic genius: for I at last thought myself to be in
possession of a charm to enable me--far beyond the phraseology of our
usual æsthetics--to represent vividly to my mind the primitive problem
of tragedy: whereby such an astounding insight into the Hellenic
character was afforded me that it necessarily seemed as if our proudly
comporting classico-Hellenic science had thus far contrived to subsist
almost exclusively on phantasmagoria and externalities.

Perhaps we may lead up to this primitive problem with the question:
what æsthetic effect results when the intrinsically separate
art-powers, the Apollonian and the Dionysian, enter into concurrent
actions? Or, in briefer form: how is music related to image and
concept?--Schopenhauer, whom Richard Wagner, with especial reference to
this point, accredits with an unsurpassable clearness and perspicuity
of exposition, expresses himself most copiously on the subject in
the following passage which I shall cite here at full length[21]
(_Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. p. 309): "According to all
this, we may regard the phenomenal world, or nature, and music as
two different expressions of the same thing,[20] which is therefore
itself the only medium of the analogy between these two expressions,
so that a knowledge of this medium is required in order to understand
that analogy. Music, therefore, if regarded as an expression of the
world, is in the highest degree a universal language, which is related
indeed to the universality of concepts, much as these are related to
the particular things. Its universality, however, is by no means the
empty universality of abstraction, but of quite a different kind, and
is united with thorough and distinct definiteness. In this respect it
resembles geometrical figures and numbers, which are the universal
forms of all possible objects of experience and applicable to them all
_a priori_, and yet are not abstract but perceptiple and thoroughly
determinate. All possible efforts, excitements and manifestations of
will, all that goes on in the heart of man and that reason includes in
the wide, negative concept of feeling, may be expressed by the infinite
number of possible melodies, but always in the universality of mere
form, without the material, always according to the thing-in-itself,
not the phenomenon,--of which they reproduce the very soul and essence
as it were, without the body. This deep relation which music bears to
the true nature of all things also explains the fact that suitable
music played to any scene, action, event, or surrounding seems to
disclose to us its most secret meaning, and appears as the most
accurate and distinct commentary upon it; as also the fact that whoever
gives himself up entirely to the impression of a symphony seems to see
all the possible events of life and the world take place in himself:
nevertheless upon reflection he can find no likeness between the music
and the things that passed before his mind. For, as we have said, music
is distinguished from all the other arts by the fact that it is not a
copy of the phenomenon, or, more accurately, the adequate objectivity
of the will, but the direct copy of the will itself, and therefore
represents the metaphysical of everything physical in the world, and
the thing-in-itself of every phenomenon. We might, therefore, just as
well call the world embodied music as embodied will: and this is the
reason why music makes every picture, and indeed every scene of real
life and of the world, at once appear with higher significance; all the
more so, to be sure, in proportion as its melody is analogous to the
inner spirit of the given phenomenon. It rests upon this that we are
able to set a poem to music as a song, or a perceptible representation
as a pantomime, or both as an opera. Such particular pictures of human
life, set to the universal language of music, are never bound to it
or correspond to it with stringent necessity, but stand to it only
in the relation of an example chosen at will to a general concept.
In the determinateness of the real they represent that which music
expresses in the universality of mere form. For melodies are to a
certain extent, like general concepts, an abstraction from the actual.
This actual world, then, the world of particular things, affords the
object of perception, the special and the individual, the particular
case, both to the universality of concepts and to the universality of
the melodies. But these two universalities are in a certain respect
opposed to each other; for the concepts contain only the forms, which
are first of all abstracted from perception,--the separated outward
shell of things, as it were,--and hence they are, in the strictest
sense of the term, _abstracta_; music, on the other hand, gives the
inmost kernel which precedes all forms, or the heart of things. This
relation may be very well expressed in the language of the schoolmen,
by saying: the concepts are the _universalia post rem,_ but music gives
the _universalia ante rem,_ and the real world the _universalia in
re._--But that in general a relation is possible between a composition
and a perceptible representation rests, as we have said, upon the
fact that both are simply different expressions of the same inner
being of the world. When now, in the particular case, such a relation
is actually given, that is to say, when the composer has been able to
express in the universal language of music the emotions of will which
constitute the heart of an event, then the melody of the song, the
music of the opera, is expressive. But the analogy discovered by the
composer between the two must have proceeded from the direct knowledge
of the nature of the world unknown to his reason, and must not be an
imitation produced with conscious intention by means of conceptions;
otherwise the music does not express the inner nature of the will
itself, but merely gives an inadequate imitation of its phenomenon: all
specially imitative music does this."

We have therefore, according to the doctrine of Schopenhauer, an
immediate understanding of music as the language of the will, and
feel our imagination stimulated to give form to this invisible and
yet so actively stirred spirit-world which speaks to us, and prompted
to embody it in an analogous example. On the other hand, image and
concept, under the influence of a truly conformable music, acquire a
higher significance. Dionysian art therefore is wont to exercise--two
kinds of influences, on the Apollonian art-faculty: music firstly
incites to the _symbolic intuition_ of Dionysian universality, and,
secondly, it causes the symbolic image to stand forth _in its fullest
significance._ From these facts, intelligible in themselves and not
inaccessible to profounder observation, I infer the capacity of music
to give birth to _myth,_ that is to say, the most significant exemplar,
and precisely _tragic_ myth: the myth which speaks of Dionysian
knowledge in symbols. In the phenomenon of the lyrist, I have set forth
that in him music strives to express itself with regard to its nature
in Apollonian images. If now we reflect that music in its highest
potency must seek to attain also to its highest symbolisation, we must
deem it possible that it also knows how to find the symbolic expression
of its inherent Dionysian wisdom; and where shall we have to seek for
this expression if not in tragedy and, in general, in the conception of
the _tragic_?

From the nature of art, as it is ordinarily conceived according to
the single category of appearance and beauty, the tragic cannot be
honestly deduced at all; it is only through the spirit of music that
we understand the joy in the annihilation of the individual. For in
the particular examples of such annihilation only is the eternal
phenomenon of Dionysian art made clear to us, which gives expression
to the will in its omnipotence, as it were, behind the _principium
individuationis,_ the eternal life beyond all phenomena, and in
spite of all annihilation. The metaphysical delight in the tragic
is a translation of the instinctively unconscious Dionysian wisdom
into the language of the scene: the hero, the highest manifestation
of the will, is disavowed for our pleasure, because he is only
phenomenon, and because the eternal life of the will is not affected
by his annihilation. "We believe in eternal life," tragedy exclaims;
while music is the proximate idea of this life. Plastic art has an
altogether different object: here Apollo vanquishes the suffering of
the individual by the radiant glorification of the _eternity of the
phenomenon_; here beauty triumphs over the suffering inherent in life;
pain is in a manner surreptitiously obliterated from the features of
nature. In Dionysian art and its tragic symbolism the same nature
speaks to us with its true undissembled voice: "Be as I am! Amidst the
ceaseless change of phenomena the eternally creative primordial mother,
eternally impelling to existence, self-satisfying eternally with this
change of phenomena!"

Haldane and Kemp.

[21] That is "the will" as understood by Schopenhauer.--TR.



17.


Dionysian art, too, seeks to convince us of the eternal joy of
existence: only we are to seek this joy not in phenomena, but behind
phenomena. We are to perceive how all that comes into being must be
ready for a sorrowful end; we are compelled to look into the terrors of
individual existence--yet we are not to become torpid: a metaphysical
comfort tears us momentarily from the bustle of the transforming
figures. We are really for brief moments Primordial Being itself,
and feel its indomitable desire for being and joy in existence; the
struggle, the pain, the destruction of phenomena, now appear to us as
something necessary, considering the surplus of innumerable forms of
existence which throng and push one another into life, considering
the exuberant fertility of the universal will. We are pierced by the
maddening sting of these pains at the very moment when we have become,
as it were, one with the immeasurable primordial joy in existence,
and when we anticipate, in Dionysian ecstasy, the indestructibility
and eternity of this joy. In spite of fear and pity, we are the happy
living beings, not as individuals, but as the _one_ living being, with
whose procreative joy we are blended.

The history of the rise of Greek tragedy now tells us with luminous
precision that the tragic art of the Greeks was really born of the
spirit of music: with which conception we believe we have done justice
for the first time to the original and most astonishing significance of
the chorus. At the same time, however, we must admit that the import of
tragic myth as set forth above never became transparent with sufficient
lucidity to the Greek poets, let alone the Greek philosophers; their
heroes speak, as it were, more superficially than they act; the myth
does not at all find its adequate objectification in the spoken word.
The structure of the scenes and the conspicuous images reveal a deeper
wisdom than the poet himself can put into words and concepts: the same
being also observed in Shakespeare, whose Hamlet, for instance, in an
analogous manner talks more superficially than he acts, so that the
previously mentioned lesson of Hamlet is to be gathered not from his
words, but from a more profound contemplation and survey of the whole.
With respect to Greek tragedy, which of course presents itself to us
only as word-drama, I have even intimated that the incongruence between
myth and expression might easily tempt us to regard it as shallower
and less significant than it really is, and accordingly to postulate
for it a more superficial effect than it must have had according to
the testimony of the ancients: for how easily one forgets that what
the word-poet did not succeed in doing, namely realising the highest
spiritualisation and ideality of myth, he might succeed in doing
every moment as creative musician! We require, to be sure, almost by
philological method to reconstruct for ourselves the ascendency of
musical influence in order to receive something of the incomparable
comfort which must be characteristic of true tragedy. Even this musical
ascendency, however, would only have been felt by us as such had
we been Greeks: while in the entire development of Greek music--as
compared with the infinitely richer music known and familiar to us--we
imagine we hear only the youthful song of the musical genius intoned
with a feeling of diffidence. The Greeks are, as the Egyptian priests
say, eternal children, and in tragic art also they are only children
who do not know what a sublime play-thing has originated under their
hands and--is being demolished.

That striving of the spirit of music for symbolic and mythical
manifestation, which increases from the beginnings of lyric poetry to
Attic tragedy, breaks off all of a sudden immediately after attaining
luxuriant development, and disappears, as it were, from the surface
of Hellenic art: while the Dionysian view of things born of this
striving lives on in Mysteries and, in its strangest metamorphoses and
debasements, does not cease to attract earnest natures. Will it not one
day rise again as art out of its mystic depth?

Here the question occupies us, whether the power by the counteracting
influence of which tragedy perished, has for all time strength enough
to prevent the artistic reawaking of tragedy and of the tragic view
of things. If ancient tragedy was driven from its course by the
dialectical desire for knowledge and the optimism of science, it might
be inferred that there is an eternal conflict between _the theoretic_
and _the tragic view of things,_ and only after the spirit of science
has been led to its boundaries, and its claim to universal validity
has been destroyed by the evidence of these boundaries, can we hope
for a re-birth of tragedy: for which form of culture we should have to
use the symbol _of the music-practising Socrates_ in the sense spoken
of above. In this contrast, I understand by the spirit of science the
belief which first came to light in the person of Socrates,--the belief
in the fathomableness of nature and in knowledge as a panacea.

He who recalls the immediate consequences of this restlessly
onward-pressing spirit of science will realise at once that _myth_
was annihilated by it, and that, in consequence of this annihilation,
poetry was driven as a homeless being from her natural ideal soil.
If we have rightly assigned to music the capacity to reproduce myth
from itself, we may in turn expect to find the spirit of science on
the path where it inimically opposes this mythopoeic power of music.
This takes place in the development of the _New Attic Dithyramb,_ the
music of which no longer expressed the inner essence, the will itself,
but only rendered the phenomenon insufficiently, in an imitation by
means of concepts; from which intrinsically degenerate music the truly
musical natures turned away with the same repugnance that they felt
for the art-destroying tendency of Socrates. The unerring instinct of
Aristophanes surely did the proper thing when it comprised Socrates
himself, the tragedy of Euripides, and the music of the new Dithyrambic
poets in the same feeling of hatred, and perceived in all three
phenomena the symptoms of a degenerate culture. By this New Dithyramb,
music has in an outrageous manner been made the imitative portrait of
phenomena, for instance, of a battle or a storm at sea, and has thus,
of course, been entirely deprived of its mythopoeic power. For if it
endeavours to excite our delight only by compelling us to seek external
analogies between a vital or natural process and certain rhythmical
figures and characteristic sounds of music; if our understanding is
expected to satisfy itself with the perception of these analogies, we
are reduced to a frame of mind in which the reception of the mythical
is impossible; for the myth as a unique exemplar of generality
and truth towering into the infinite, desires to be conspicuously
perceived. The truly Dionysean music presents itself to us as such
a general mirror of the universal will: the conspicuous event which
is refracted in this mirror expands at once for our consciousness to
the copy of an eternal truth. Conversely, such a conspicious event is
at once divested of every mythical character by the tone-painting
of the New Dithyramb; music has here become a wretched copy of the
phenomenon, and therefore infinitely poorer than the phenomenon itself:
through which poverty it still further reduces even the phenomenon for
our consciousness, so that now, for instance, a musically imitated
battle of this sort exhausts itself in marches, signal-sounds, etc.,
and our imagination is arrested precisely by these superficialities.
Tone-painting is therefore in every respect the counterpart of true
music with its mythopoeic power: through it the phenomenon, poor in
itself, is made still poorer, while through an isolated Dionysian music
the phenomenon is evolved and expanded into a picture of the world.
It was an immense triumph of the non-Dionysian spirit, when, in the
development of the New Dithyramb, it had estranged music from itself
and reduced it to be the slave of phenomena. Euripides, who, albeit in
a higher sense, must be designated as a thoroughly unmusical nature,
is for this very reason a passionate adherent of the New Dithyrambic
Music, and with the liberality of a freebooter employs all its
effective turns and mannerisms.

In another direction also we see at work the power of this
un-Dionysian, myth-opposing spirit, when we turn our eyes to the
prevalence of _character representation_ and psychological refinement
from Sophocles onwards. The character must no longer be expanded into
an eternal type, but, on the contrary, must operate individually
through artistic by-traits and shadings, through the nicest precision
of all lines, in such a manner that the spectator is in general no
longer conscious of the myth, but of the mighty nature-myth and the
imitative power of the artist. Here also we observe the victory of
the phenomenon over the Universal, and the delight in the particular
quasi-anatomical preparation; we actually breathe the air of a
theoretical world, in which scientific knowledge is valued more highly
than the artistic reflection of a universal law. The movement along
the line of the representation of character proceeds rapidly: while
Sophocles still delineates complete characters and employs myth for
their refined development, Euripides already delineates only prominent
individual traits of character, which can express themselves in violent
bursts of passion; in the New Attic Comedy, however, there are only
masks with _one_ expression: frivolous old men, duped panders, and
cunning slaves in untiring repetition. Where now is the mythopoeic
spirit of music? What is still left now of music is either excitatory
music or souvenir music, that is, either a stimulant for dull and
used-up nerves, or tone-painting. As regards the former, it hardly
matters about the text set to it: the heroes and choruses of Euripides
are already dissolute enough when once they begin to sing; to what pass
must things have come with his brazen successors?

The new un-Dionysian spirit, however, manifests itself most clearly in
the _dénouements_ of the new dramas. In the Old Tragedy one could feel
at the close the metaphysical comfort, without which the delight in
tragedy cannot be explained at all; the conciliating tones from another
world sound purest, perhaps, in the Œdipus at Colonus. Now that the
genius of music has fled from tragedy, tragedy is, strictly speaking,
dead: for from whence could one now draw the metaphysical comfort? One
sought, therefore, for an earthly unravelment of the tragic dissonance;
the hero, after he had been sufficiently tortured by fate, reaped a
well-deserved reward through a superb marriage or divine tokens of
favour. The hero had turned gladiator, on whom, after being liberally
battered about and covered with wounds, freedom was occasionally
bestowed. The _deus ex machina_ took the place of metaphysical comfort.
I will not say that the tragic view of things was everywhere completely
destroyed by the intruding spirit of the un-Dionysian: we only know
that it was compelled to flee from art into the under-world as it were,
in the degenerate form of a secret cult. Over the widest extent of the
Hellenic character, however, there raged the consuming blast of this
spirit, which manifests itself in the form of "Greek cheerfulness,"
which we have already spoken of as a senile, unproductive love of
existence; this cheerfulness is the counterpart of the splendid
"naïveté" of the earlier Greeks, which, according to the characteristic
indicated above, must be conceived as the blossom of the Apollonian
culture growing out of a dark abyss, as the victory which the Hellenic
will, through its mirroring of beauty, obtains over suffering and the
wisdom of suffering. The noblest manifestation of that other form of
"Greek cheerfulness," the Alexandrine, is the cheerfulness of the
_theoretical man_: it exhibits the same symptomatic characteristics as
I have just inferred concerning the spirit of the un-Dionysian:--it
combats Dionysian wisdom and art, it seeks to dissolve myth, it
substitutes for metaphysical comfort an earthly consonance, in fact, a
_deus ex machina_ of its own, namely the god of machines and crucibles,
that is, the powers of the genii of nature recognised and employed in
the service of higher egoism; it believes in amending the world by
knowledge, in guiding life by science, and that it can really confine
the individual within a narrow sphere of solvable problems, where he
cheerfully says to life: "I desire thee: it is worth while to know
thee."

It is an eternal phenomenon: the avidious will can always, by means
of an illusion spread over things, detain its creatures in life
and compel them to live on. One is chained by the Socratic love of
knowledge and the vain hope of being able thereby to heal the eternal
wound of existence; another is ensnared by art's seductive veil of
beauty fluttering before his eyes; still another by the metaphysical
comfort that eternal life flows on indestructibly beneath the whirl of
phenomena: to say nothing of the more ordinary and almost more powerful
illusions which the will has always at hand. These three specimens of
illusion are on the whole designed only for the more nobly endowed
natures, who in general feel profoundly the weight and burden of
existence, and must be deluded into forgetfulness of their displeasure
by exquisite stimulants. All that we call culture is made up of these
stimulants; and, according to the proportion of the ingredients, we
have either a specially _Socratic_ or _artistic_ or _tragic culture_:
or, if historical exemplifications are wanted, there is either an
Alexandrine or a Hellenic or a Buddhistic culture.

Our whole modern world is entangled in the meshes of Alexandrine
culture, and recognises as its ideal the _theorist_ equipped with
the most potent means of knowledge, and labouring in the service of
science, of whom the archetype and progenitor is Socrates. All our
educational methods have originally this ideal in view: every other
form of existence must struggle onwards wearisomely beside it, as
something tolerated, but not intended. In an almost alarming manner the
cultured man was here found for a long time only in the form of the
scholar: even our poetical arts have been forced to evolve from learned
imitations, and in the main effect of the rhyme we still recognise the
origin of our poetic form from artistic experiments with a non-native
and thoroughly learned language. How unintelligible must _Faust,_ the
modern cultured man, who is in himself intelligible, have appeared to a
true Greek,--Faust, storming discontentedly through all the faculties,
devoted to magic and the devil from a desire for knowledge, whom we
have only to place alongside of Socrates for the purpose of comparison,
in order to see that modern man begins to divine the boundaries of
this Socratic love of perception and longs for a coast in the wide
waste of the ocean of knowledge. When Goethe on one occasion said to
Eckermann with reference to Napoleon: "Yes, my good friend, there is
also a productiveness of deeds," he reminded us in a charmingly naïve
manner that the non-theorist is something incredible and astounding to
modern man; so that the wisdom of Goethe is needed once more in order
to discover that such a surprising form of existence is comprehensible,
nay even pardonable.

Now, we must not hide from ourselves what is concealed in the heart
of this Socratic culture: Optimism, deeming itself absolute! Well, we
must not be alarmed if the fruits of this optimism ripen,--if society,
leavened to the very lowest strata by this kind of culture, gradually
begins to tremble through wanton agitations and desires, if the belief
in the earthly happiness of all, if the belief in the possibility of
such a general intellectual culture is gradually transformed into the
threatening demand for such an Alexandrine earthly happiness, into
the conjuring of a Euripidean _deus ex machina._ Let us mark this
well: the Alexandrine culture requires a slave class, to be able to
exist permanently: but, in its optimistic view of life, it denies the
necessity of such a class, and consequently, when the effect of its
beautifully seductive and tranquillising utterances about the "dignity
of man" and the "dignity of labour" is spent, it gradually drifts
towards a dreadful destination. There is nothing more terrible than
a barbaric slave class, who have learned to regard their existence
as an injustice, and now prepare to take vengeance, not only for
themselves, but for all generations. In the face of such threatening
storms, who dares to appeal with confident spirit to our pale and
exhausted religions, which even in their foundations have degenerated
into scholastic religions?--so that myth, the necessary prerequisite
of every religion, is already paralysed everywhere, and even in this
domain the optimistic spirit--which we have just designated as the
annihilating germ of society--has attained the mastery.

While the evil slumbering in the heart of theoretical culture gradually
begins to disquiet modern man, and makes him anxiously ransack the
stores of his experience for means to avert the danger, though not
believing very much in these means; while he, therefore, begins to
divine the consequences his position involves: great, universally
gifted natures have contrived, with an incredible amount of thought, to
make use of the apparatus of science itself, in order to point out the
limits and the relativity of knowledge generally, and thus definitely
to deny the claim of science to universal validity and universal ends:
with which demonstration the illusory notion was for the first time
recognised as such, which pretends, with the aid of causality, to be
able to fathom the innermost essence of things. The extraordinary
courage and wisdom of _Kant_ and _Schopenhauer_ have succeeded in
gaining the most, difficult, victory, the victory over the optimism
hidden in the essence of logic, which optimism in turn is the basis of
our culture. While this optimism, resting on apparently unobjectionable
_æterna veritates,_ believed in the intelligibility and solvability of
all the riddles of the world, and treated space, time, and causality
as totally unconditioned laws of the most universal validity, Kant, on
the other hand, showed that these served in reality only to elevate the
mere phenomenon, the work of Mâyâ, to the sole and highest reality,
putting it in place of the innermost and true essence of things, thus
making the actual knowledge of this essence impossible, that is,
according to the expression of Schopenhauer, to lull the dreamer still
more soundly asleep (_Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. 498). With
this knowledge a culture is inaugurated which I venture to designate as
a tragic culture; the most important characteristic of which is that
wisdom takes the place of science as the highest end,--wisdom, which,
uninfluenced by the seductive distractions of the sciences, turns
with unmoved eye to the comprehensive view of the world, and seeks to
apprehend therein the eternal suffering as its own with sympathetic
feelings of love. Let us imagine a rising generation with this
undauntedness of vision, with this heroic desire for the prodigious,
let us imagine the bold step of these dragon-slayers, the proud and
daring spirit with which they turn their backs on all the effeminate
doctrines of optimism in order "to live resolutely" in the Whole and in
the Full: would it not be necessary for the tragic man of this culture,
with his self-discipline to earnestness and terror, to desire a new
art, the art of metaphysical comfort,--namely, tragedy, as the Hellena
belonging to him, and that he should exclaim with Faust:

    Und sollt' ich nicht, sehnsüchtigster Gewalt,
    In's Leben ziehn die einzigste Gestalt?[21]

But now that the Socratic culture has been shaken from two directions,
and is only able to hold the sceptre of its infallibility with
trembling hands,--once by the fear of its own conclusions which it at
length begins to surmise, and again, because it is no longer convinced
with its former naïve trust of the eternal validity of its foundation,
--it is a sad spectacle to behold how the dance of its thought always
rushes longingly on new forms, to embrace them, and then, shuddering,
lets them go of a sudden, as Mephistopheles does the seductive Lamiæ.
It is certainly the symptom of the "breach" which all are wont to speak
of as the primordial suffering of modern culture that the theoretical
man, alarmed and dissatisfied at his own conclusions, no longer dares
to entrust himself to the terrible ice-stream of existence: he runs
timidly up and down the bank. He no longer wants to have anything
entire, with all the natural cruelty of things, so thoroughly has he
been spoiled by his optimistic contemplation. Besides, he feels that
a culture built up on the principles of science must perish when it
begins to grow _illogical,_ that is, to avoid its own conclusions.
Our art reveals this universal trouble: in vain does one seek help by
imitating all the great productive periods and natures, in vain does
one accumulate the entire "world-literature" around modern man for
his comfort, in vain does one place one's self in the midst of the
art-styles and artists of all ages, so that one may give names to them
as Adam did to the beasts: one still continues the eternal hungerer,
the "critic" without joy and energy, the Alexandrine man, who is in
the main a librarian and corrector of proofs, and who, pitiable wretch
goes blind from the dust of books and printers' errors.

We cannot designate the intrinsic substance of Socratic culture more
distinctly than by calling it _the culture of the opera_: for it is in
this department that culture has expressed itself with special naïveté
concerning its aims and perceptions, which is sufficiently surprising
when we compare the genesis of the opera and the facts of operatic
development with the eternal truths of the Apollonian and Dionysian.
I call to mind first of all the origin of the _stilo rappresentativo_
and the recitative. Is it credible that this thoroughly externalised
operatic music, incapable of devotion, could be received and cherished
with enthusiastic favour, as a re-birth, as it were, of all true music,
by the very age in which the ineffably sublime and sacred music of
Palestrina had originated? And who, on the other hand, would think of
making only the diversion-craving luxuriousness of those Florentine
circles and the vanity of their dramatic singers responsible for the
love of the opera which spread with such rapidity? That in the same
age, even among the same people, this passion for a half-musical
mode of speech should awaken alongside of the vaulted structure
of Palestrine harmonies which the entire Christian Middle Age had
been building up, I can explain to myself only by a co-operating
_extra-artistic tendency_ in the essence of the recitative.

The listener, who insists on distinctly hearing the words under the
music, has his wishes met by the singer in that he speaks rather than
sings, and intensifies the pathetic expression of the words in this
half-song: by this intensification of the pathos he facilitates the
understanding of the words and surmounts the remaining half of the
music. The specific danger which now threatens him is that in some
unguarded moment he may give undue importance to music, which would
forthwith result in the destruction of the pathos of the speech and
the distinctness of the words: while, on the other hand, he always
feels himself impelled to musical delivery and to virtuose exhibition
of vocal talent. Here the "poet" comes to his aid, who knows how to
provide him with abundant opportunities for lyrical interjections,
repetitions of words and sentences, etc.,--at which places the singer,
now in the purely musical element, can rest himself without minding the
words. This alternation of emotionally impressive, yet only half-sung
speech and wholly sung interjections, which is characteristic of the
_stilo rappresentativo,_ this rapidly changing endeavour to operate
now on the conceptional and representative faculty of the hearer, now
on his musical sense, is something so thoroughly unnatural and withal
so intrinsically contradictory both to the Apollonian and Dionysian
artistic impulses, that one has to infer an origin of the recitative
foreign to all artistic instincts. The recitative must be defined,
according to this description, as the combination of epic and lyric
delivery, not indeed as an intrinsically stable combination which
could not be attained in the case of such totally disparate elements,
but an entirely superficial mosaic conglutination, such as is totally
unprecedented in the domain of nature and experience. _But this was
not the opinion of the inventors of the recitative:_ they themselves,
and their age with them, believed rather that the mystery of antique
music had been solved by this _stilo rappresentativo,_ in which, as
they thought, the only explanation of the enormous influence of an
Orpheus, an Amphion, and even of Greek tragedy was to be found. The new
style was regarded by them as the re-awakening of the most effective
music, the Old Greek music: indeed, with the universal and popular
conception of the Homeric world _as the primitive world,_ they could
abandon themselves to the dream of having descended once more into the
paradisiac beginnings of mankind, wherein music also must needs have
had the unsurpassed purity, power, and innocence of which the poets
could give such touching accounts in their pastoral plays. Here we see
into the internal process of development of this thoroughly modern
variety of art, the opera: a powerful need here acquires an art, but
it is a need of an unæsthetic kind: the yearning for the idyll, the
belief in the prehistoric existence of the artistic, good man. The
recitative was regarded as the rediscovered language of this primitive
man; the opera as the recovered land of this idyllically or heroically
good creature, who in every action follows at the same time a natural
artistic impulse, who sings a little along with all he has to say, in
order to sing immediately with full voice on the slightest emotional
excitement. It is now a matter of indifference to us that the humanists
of those days combated the old ecclesiastical representation of man
as naturally corrupt and lost, with this new-created picture of the
paradisiac artist: so that opera may be understood as the oppositional
dogma of the good man, whereby however a solace was at the same time
found for the pessimism to which precisely the seriously-disposed
men of that time were most strongly incited, owing to the frightful
uncertainty of all conditions of life. It is enough to have perceived
that the intrinsic charm, and therefore the genesis, of this new form
of art lies in the gratification of an altogether unæsthetic need, in
the optimistic glorification of man as such, in the conception of the
primitive man as the man naturally good and artistic: a principle of
the opera which has gradually changed into a threatening and terrible
_demand,_ which, in face of the socialistic movements of the present
time, we can no longer ignore. The "good primitive man" wants his
rights: what paradisiac prospects!

I here place by way of parallel still another equally obvious
confirmation of my view that opera is built up on the same principles
as our Alexandrine culture. Opera is the birth of the theoretical man,
of the critical layman, not of the artist: one of the most surprising
facts in the whole history of art. It was the demand of thoroughly
unmusical hearers that the words must above all be understood, so
that according to them a re-birth of music is only to be expected
when some mode of singing has been discovered in which the text-word
lords over the counterpoint as the master over the servant. For the
words, it is argued, are as much nobler than the accompanying harmonic
system as the soul is nobler than the body. It was in accordance with
the laically unmusical crudeness of these views that the combination
of music, picture and expression was effected in the beginnings of
the opera: in the spirit of this æsthetics the first experiments
were also made in the leading laic circles of Florence by the poets
and singers patronised there. The man incapable of art creates for
himself a species of art precisely because he is the inartistic man
as such. Because he does not divine the Dionysian depth of music, he
changes his musical taste into appreciation of the understandable
word-and-tone-rhetoric of the passions in the _stilo rappresentativo,_
and into the voluptuousness of the arts of song; because he is unable
to behold a vision, he forces the machinist and the decorative artist
into his service; because he cannot apprehend the true nature of the
artist, he conjures up the "artistic primitive man" to suit his taste,
that is, the man who sings and recites verses under the influence
of passion. He dreams himself into a time when passion suffices to
generate songs and poems: as if emotion had ever been able to create
anything artistic. The postulate of the opera is a false belief
concerning the artistic process, in fact, the idyllic belief that every
sentient man is an artist. In the sense of this belief, opera is the
expression of the taste of the laity in art, who dictate their laws
with the cheerful optimism of the theorist.

Should we desire to unite in one the two conceptions just set forth
as influential in the origin of opera, it would only remain for us to
speak of an _idyllic tendency of the opera_: in which connection we
may avail ourselves exclusively of the phraseology and illustration of
Schiller.[22] "Nature and the ideal," he says, "are either objects of
grief, when the former is represented as lost, the latter unattained;
or both are objects of joy, in that they are represented as real.
The first case furnishes the elegy in its narrower signification,
the second the idyll in its widest sense." Here we must at once call
attention to the common characteristic of these two conceptions in
operatic genesis, namely, that in them the ideal is not regarded as
unattained or nature as lost Agreeably to this sentiment, there was
a primitive age of man when he lay close to the heart of nature,
and, owing to this naturalness, had attained the ideal of mankind in
a paradisiac goodness and artist-organisation: from which perfect
primitive man all of us were supposed to be descended; whose faithful
copy we were in fact still said to be: only we had to cast off some
few things in order to recognise ourselves once more as this primitive
man, on the strength of a voluntary renunciation of superfluous
learnedness, of super-abundant culture. It was to such a concord of
nature and the ideal, to an idyllic reality, that the cultured man
of the Renaissance suffered himself to be led back by his operatic
imitation of Greek tragedy; he made use of this tragedy, as Dante made
use of Vergil, in order to be led up to the gates of paradise: while
from this point he went on without assistance and passed over from an
imitation of the highest form of Greek art to a "restoration of all
things," to an imitation of man's original art-world. What delightfully
naïve hopefulness of these daring endeavours, in the very heart of
theoretical culture!--solely to be explained by the comforting belief,
that "man-in-himself" is the eternally virtuous hero of the opera,
the eternally fluting or singing shepherd, who must always in the end
rediscover himself as such, if he has at any time really lost himself;
solely the fruit of the optimism, which here rises like a sweetishly
seductive column of vapour out of the depth of the Socratic conception
of the world.

The features of the opera therefore do not by any means exhibit the
elegiac sorrow of an eternal loss, but rather the cheerfulness of
eternal rediscovery, the indolent delight in an idyllic reality which
one can at least represent to one's self each moment as real: and in
so doing one will perhaps surmise some day that this supposed reality
is nothing but a fantastically silly dawdling, concerning which every
one, who could judge it by the terrible earnestness of true nature
and compare it with the actual primitive scenes of the beginnings of
mankind, would have to call out with loathing: Away with the phantom!
Nevertheless one would err if one thought it possible to frighten
away merely by a vigorous shout such a dawdling thing as the opera,
as if it were a spectre. He who would destroy the opera must join
issue with Alexandrine cheerfulness, which expresses itself so naïvely
therein concerning its favourite representation; of which in fact
it is the specific form of art. But what is to be expected for art
itself from the operation of a form of art, the beginnings of which
do not at all lie in the æsthetic province; which has rather stolen
over from a half-moral sphere into the artistic domain, and has been
able only now and then to delude us concerning this hybrid origin? By
what sap is this parasitic opera-concern nourished, if not by that
of true art? Must we not suppose that the highest and indeed the
truly serious task of art--to free the eye from its glance into the
horrors of night and to deliver the "subject" by the healing balm of
appearance from the spasms of volitional agitations--will degenerate
under the influence of its idyllic seductions and Alexandrine
adulation to an empty dissipating tendency, to pastime? What will
become of the eternal truths of the Dionysian and Apollonian in such
an amalgamation of styles as I have exhibited in the character of the
_stilo rappresentativo_? where music is regarded as the servant, the
text as the master, where music is compared with the body, the text
with the soul? where at best the highest aim will be the realisation
of a paraphrastic tone-painting, just as formerly in the New Attic
Dithyramb? where music is completely alienated from its true dignity
of being, the Dionysian mirror of the world, so that the only thing
left to it is, as a slave of phenomena, to imitate the formal character
thereof, and to excite an external pleasure in the play of lines and
proportions. On close observation, this fatal influence of the opera
on music is seen to coincide absolutely with the universal development
of modern music; the optimism lurking in the genesis of the opera and
in the essence of culture represented thereby, has, with alarming
rapidity, succeeded in divesting music of its Dionyso-cosmic mission
and in impressing on it a playfully formal and pleasurable character: a
change with which perhaps only the metamorphosis of the Æschylean man
into the cheerful Alexandrine man could be compared.

If, however, in the exemplification herewith indicated we have rightly
associated the evanescence of the Dionysian spirit with a most
striking, but hitherto unexplained transformation and degeneration of
the Hellene--what hopes must revive in us when the most trustworthy
auspices guarantee _the reverse process, the gradual awakening of
the Dionysian spirit_ in our modern world! It is impossible for the
divine strength of Herakles to languish for ever in voluptuous bondage
to Omphale. Out of the Dionysian root of the German spirit a power
has arisen which has nothing in common with the primitive conditions
of Socratic culture, and can neither be explained nor excused
thereby, but is rather regarded by this culture as something terribly
inexplicable and overwhelmingly hostile,--namely, _German music_ as
we have to understand it, especially in its vast solar orbit from
Bach to Beethoven, from Beethoven to Wagner. What even under the most
favourable circumstances can the knowledge-craving Socratism of our
days do with this demon rising from unfathomable depths? Neither by
means of the zig-zag and arabesque work of operatic melody, nor with
the aid of the arithmetical counting board of fugue and contrapuntal
dialectics is the formula to be found, in the trebly powerful light[23]
of which one could subdue this demon and compel it to speak. What
a spectacle, when our æsthetes, with a net of "beauty" peculiar to
themselves, now pursue and clutch at the genius of music romping
about before them with incomprehensible life, and in so doing display
activities which are not to be judged by the standard of eternal beauty
any more than by the standard of the sublime. Let us but observe these
patrons of music as they are, at close range, when they call out so
indefatigably "beauty! beauty!" to discover whether they have the marks
of nature's darling children who are fostered and fondled in the lap
of the beautiful, or whether they do not rather seek a disguise for
their own rudeness, an æsthetical pretext for their own unemotional
insipidity: I am thinking here, for instance, of Otto Jahn. But let the
liar and the hypocrite beware of our German music: for in the midst
of all our culture it is really the only genuine, pure and purifying
fire-spirit from which and towards which, as in the teaching of the
great Heraclitus of Ephesus, all things move in a double orbit-all
that we now call culture, education, civilisation, must appear some day
before the unerring judge, Dionysus.

Let us recollect furthermore how Kant and Schopenhauer made it
possible for the spirit of _German philosophy_ streaming from the
same sources to annihilate the satisfied delight in existence of
scientific Socratism by the delimitation of the boundaries thereof; how
through this delimitation an infinitely profounder and more serious
view of ethical problems and of art was inaugurated, which we may
unhesitatingly designate as _Dionysian_ wisdom comprised in concepts.
To what then does the mystery of this oneness of German music and
philosophy point, if not to a new form of existence, concerning the
substance of which we can only inform ourselves presentiently from
Hellenic analogies? For to us who stand on the boundary line between
two different forms of existence, the Hellenic prototype retains the
immeasurable value, that therein all these transitions and struggles
are imprinted in a classically instructive form: except that we, as
it were, experience analogically in _reverse_ order the chief epochs
of the Hellenic genius, and seem now, for instance, to pass backwards
from the Alexandrine age to the period of tragedy. At the same time
we have the feeling that the birth of a tragic age betokens only a
return to itself of the German spirit, a blessed self-rediscovering
after excessive and urgent external influences have for a long time
compelled it, living as it did in helpless barbaric formlessness, to
servitude under their form. It may at last, after returning to the
primitive source of its being, venture to stalk along boldly and freely
before all nations without hugging the leading-strings of a Romanic
civilisation: if only it can learn implicitly of one people--the
Greeks, of whom to learn at all is itself a high honour and a rare
distinction. And when did we require these highest of all teachers more
than at present, when we experience _a re-birth of tragedy_ and are in
danger alike of not knowing whence it comes, and of being unable to
make clear to ourselves whither it tends.

It may be weighed some day before an impartial judge, in what time and
in what men the German spirit has thus far striven most resolutely to
learn of the Greeks: and if we confidently assume that this unique
praise must be accorded to the noblest intellectual efforts of Goethe,
Schiller, and Winkelmann, it will certainly have to be added that
since their time, and subsequently to the more immediate influences of
these efforts, the endeavour to attain to culture and to the Greeks by
this path has in an incomprehensible manner grown feebler and feebler.
In order not to despair altogether of the German spirit, must we not
infer therefrom that possibly, in some essential matter, even these
champions could not penetrate into the core of the Hellenic nature,
and were unable to establish a permanent friendly alliance between
German and Greek culture? So that perhaps an unconscious perception
of this shortcoming might raise also in more serious minds the
disheartening doubt as to whether after such predecessors they could
advance still farther on this path of culture, or could reach the goal
at all. Accordingly, we see the opinions concerning the value of Greek
contribution to culture degenerate since that time in the most alarming
manner; the expression of compassionate superiority may be heard
in the most heterogeneous intellectual and non-intellectual camps,
and elsewhere a totally ineffective declamation dallies with "Greek
harmony," "Greek beauty," "Greek cheerfulness." And in the very circles
whose dignity it might be to draw indefatigably from the Greek channel
for the good of German culture, in the circles of the teachers in the
higher educational institutions, they have learned best to compromise
with the Greeks in good time and on easy terms, to the extent often of
a sceptical abandonment of the Hellenic ideal and a total perversion of
the true purpose of antiquarian studies. If there be any one at all in
these circles who has not completely exhausted himself in the endeavour
to be a trustworthy corrector of old texts or a natural-history
microscopist of language, he perhaps seeks also to appropriate Grecian
antiquity "historically" along with other antiquities, and in any case
according to the method and with the supercilious air of our present
cultured historiography. When, therefore, the intrinsic efficiency
of the higher educational institutions has never perhaps been lower
or feebler than at present, when the "journalist," the paper slave
of the day, has triumphed over the academic teacher in all matters
pertaining to culture, and there only remains to the latter the often
previously experienced metamorphosis of now fluttering also, as a
cheerful cultured butterfly, in the idiom of the journalist, with the
"light elegance" peculiar thereto--with what painful confusion must the
cultured persons of a period like the present gaze at the phenomenon
(which can perhaps be comprehended analogically only by means of the
profoundest principle of the hitherto unintelligible Hellenic genius)
of the reawakening of the Dionysian spirit and the re-birth of tragedy?
Never has there been another art-period in which so-called culture
and true art have been so estranged and opposed, as is so obviously
the case at present. We understand why so feeble a culture hates true
art; it fears destruction thereby. But must not an entire domain of
culture, namely the Socratic-Alexandrine, have exhausted its powers
after contriving to culminate in such a daintily-tapering point as our
present culture? When it was not permitted to heroes like Goethe and
Schiller to break open the enchanted gate which leads into the Hellenic
magic mountain, when with their most dauntless striving they did not
get beyond the longing gaze which the Goethean Iphigenia cast from
barbaric Tauris to her home across the ocean, what could the epigones
of such heroes hope for, if the gate should not open to them suddenly
of its own accord, in an entirely different position, quite overlooked
in all endeavours of culture hitherto--amidst the mystic tones of
reawakened tragic music.

Let no one attempt to weaken our faith in an impending re-birth of
Hellenic antiquity; for in it alone we find our hope of a renovation
and purification of the German spirit through the fire-magic of music.
What else do we know of amidst the present desolation and languor
of culture, which could awaken any comforting expectation for the
future? We look in vain for one single vigorously-branching root, for
a speck of fertile and healthy soil: there is dust, sand, torpidness
and languishing everywhere! Under such circumstances a cheerless
solitary wanderer could choose for himself no better symbol than the
Knight with Death and the Devil, as Dürer has sketched him for us, the
mail-clad knight, grim and stern of visage, who is able, unperturbed
by his gruesome companions, and yet hopelessly, to pursue his terrible
path with horse and hound alone. Our Schopenhauer was such a Dürerian
knight: he was destitute of all hope, but he sought the truth. There is
not his equal.

But how suddenly this gloomily depicted wilderness of our exhausted
culture changes when the Dionysian magic touches it! A hurricane
seizes everything decrepit, decaying, collapsed, and stunted; wraps
it whirlingly into a red cloud of dust; and carries it like a vulture
into the air. Confused thereby, our glances seek for what has vanished:
for what they see is something risen to the golden light as from
a depression, so full and green, so luxuriantly alive, so ardently
infinite. Tragedy sits in the midst of this exuberance of life,
sorrow and joy, in sublime ecstasy; she listens to a distant doleful
song--it tells of the Mothers of Being, whose names are: _Wahn, Wille,
Wehe_[21]--Yes, my friends, believe with me in Dionysian life and
in the re-birth of tragedy. The time of the Socratic man is past:
crown yourselves with ivy, take in your hands the thyrsus, and do not
marvel if tigers and panthers lie down fawning at your feet. Dare now
to be tragic men, for ye are to be redeemed! Ye are to accompany the
Dionysian festive procession from India to Greece! Equip yourselves for
severe conflict, but believe in the wonders of your god!



21.


Gliding back from these hortative tones into the mood which befits
the contemplative man, I repeat that it can only be learnt from the
Greeks what such a sudden and miraculous awakening of tragedy must
signify for the essential basis of a people's life. It is the people
of the tragic mysteries who fight the battles with the Persians: and
again, the people who waged such wars required tragedy as a necessary
healing potion. Who would have imagined that there was still such a
uniformly powerful effusion of the simplest political sentiments, the
most natural domestic instincts and the primitive manly delight in
strife in this very people after it had been shaken to its foundations
for several generations by the most violent convulsions of the
Dionysian demon? If at every considerable spreading of the Dionysian
commotion one always perceives that the Dionysian loosing from the
shackles of the individual makes itself felt first of all in an
increased encroachment on the political instincts, to the extent of
indifference, yea even hostility, it is certain, on the other hand,
that the state-forming Apollo is also the genius of the _principium
individuationis,_ and that the state and domestic sentiment cannot live
without an assertion of individual personality. There is only one way
from orgasm for a people,--the way to Indian Buddhism, which, in order
to be at all endured with its longing for nothingness, requires the
rare ecstatic states with their elevation above space, time, and the
individual; just as these in turn demand a philosophy which teaches how
to overcome the indescribable depression of the intermediate states by
means of a fancy. With the same necessity, owing to the unconditional
dominance of political impulses, a people drifts into a path of
extremest secularisation, the most magnificent, but also the most
terrible expression of which is the Roman _imperium_.

Placed between India and Rome, and constrained to a seductive choice,
the Greeks succeeded in devising in classical purity still a third form
of life, not indeed for long private use, but just on that account for
immortality. For it holds true in all things that those whom the gods
love die young, but, on the other hand, it holds equally true that they
then live eternally with the gods. One must not demand of what is most
noble that it should possess the durable toughness of leather; the
staunch durability, which, for instance, was inherent in the national
character of the Romans, does not probably belong to the indispensable
predicates of perfection. But if we ask by what physic it was possible
for the Greeks, in their best period, notwithstanding the extraordinary
strength of their Dionysian and political impulses, neither to exhaust
themselves by ecstatic brooding, nor by a consuming scramble for empire
and worldly honour, but to attain the splendid mixture which we find
in a noble, inflaming, and contemplatively disposing wine, we must
remember the enormous power of _tragedy,_ exciting, purifying, and
disburdening the entire life of a people; the highest value of which
we shall divine only when, as in the case of the Greeks, it appears
to us as the essence of all the prophylactic healing forces, as the
mediator arbitrating between the strongest and most inherently fateful
characteristics of a people.

Tragedy absorbs the highest musical orgasm into itself, so that it
absolutely brings music to perfection among the Greeks, as among
ourselves; but it then places alongside thereof tragic myth and the
tragic hero, who, like a mighty Titan, takes the entire Dionysian world
on his shoulders and disburdens us thereof; while, on the other hand,
it is able by means of this same tragic myth, in the person of the
tragic hero, to deliver us from the intense longing for this existence,
and reminds us with warning hand of another existence and a higher
joy, for which the struggling hero prepares himself presentiently by
his destruction, not by his victories. Tragedy sets a sublime symbol,
namely the myth between the universal authority of its music and the
receptive Dionysian hearer, and produces in him the illusion that music
is only the most effective means for the animation of the plastic world
of myth. Relying upon this noble illusion, she can now move her limbs
for the dithyrambic dance, and abandon herself unhesitatingly to an
orgiastic feeling of freedom, in which she could not venture to indulge
as music itself, without this illusion. The myth protects us from the
music, while, on the other hand, it alone gives the highest freedom
thereto. By way of return for this service, music imparts to tragic
myth such an impressive and convincing metaphysical significance as
could never be attained by word and image, without this unique aid;
and the tragic spectator in particular experiences thereby the sure
presentiment of supreme joy to which the path through destruction and
negation leads; so that he thinks he hears, as it were, the innermost
abyss of things speaking audibly to him.

If in these last propositions I have succeeded in giving perhaps only a
preliminary expression, intelligible to few at first, to this difficult
representation, I must not here desist from stimulating my friends to a
further attempt, or cease from beseeching them to prepare themselves,
by a detached example of our common experience, for the perception of
the universal proposition. In this example I must not appeal to those
who make use of the pictures of the scenic processes, the words and the
emotions of the performers, in order to approximate thereby to musical
perception; for none of these speak music as their mother-tongue,
and, in spite of the aids in question, do not get farther than the
precincts of musical perception, without ever being allowed to touch
its innermost shrines; some of them, like Gervinus, do not even reach
the precincts by this path. I have only to address myself to those
who, being immediately allied to music, have it as it were for their
mother's lap, and are connected with things almost exclusively by
unconscious musical relations. I ask the question of these genuine
musicians: whether they can imagine a man capable of hearing the third
act of _Tristan und Isolde_ without any aid of word or scenery, purely
as a vast symphonic period, without expiring by a spasmodic distention
of all the wings of the soul? A man who has thus, so to speak, put his
ear to the heart-chamber of the cosmic will, who feels the furious
desire for existence issuing therefrom as a thundering stream or most
gently dispersed brook, into all the veins of the world, would he not
collapse all at once? Could he endure, in the wretched fragile tenement
of the human individual, to hear the re-echo of countless cries of
joy and sorrow from the "vast void of cosmic night," without flying
irresistibly towards his primitive home at the sound of this pastoral
dance-song of metaphysics? But if, nevertheless, such a work can be
heard as a whole, without a renunciation of individual existence, if
such a creation could be created without demolishing its creator--where
are we to get the solution of this contradiction?

Here there interpose between our highest musical excitement and the
music in question the tragic myth and the tragic hero--in reality only
as symbols of the most universal facts, of which music alone can speak
directly. If, however, we felt as purely Dionysian beings, myth as a
symbol would stand by us absolutely ineffective and unnoticed, and
would never for a moment prevent us from giving ear to the re-echo of
the _universalia ante rem._ Here, however, the _Apollonian_ power, with
a view to the restoration of the well-nigh shattered individual, bursts
forth with the healing balm of a blissful illusion: all of a sudden
we imagine we see only Tristan, motionless, with hushed voice saying
to himself: "the old tune, why does it wake me?" And what formerly
interested us like a hollow sigh from the heart of being, seems now
only to tell us how "waste and void is the sea." And when, breathless,
we thought to expire by a convulsive distention of all our feelings,
and only a slender tie bound us to our present existence, we now hear
and see only the hero wounded to death and still not dying, with his
despairing cry: "Longing! Longing! In dying still longing! for longing
not dying!" And if formerly, after such a surplus and superabundance of
consuming agonies, the jubilation of the born rent our hearts almost
like the very acme of agony, the rejoicing Kurwenal now stands between
us and the "jubilation as such," with face turned toward the ship which
carries Isolde. However powerfully fellow-suffering encroaches upon us,
it nevertheless delivers us in a manner from the primordial suffering
of the world, just as the symbol-image of the myth delivers us from the
immediate perception of the highest cosmic idea, just as the thought
and word deliver us from the unchecked effusion of the unconscious
will. The glorious Apollonian illusion makes it appear as if the very
realm of tones presented itself to us as a plastic cosmos, as if even
the fate of Tristan and Isolde had been merely formed and moulded
therein as out of some most delicate and impressible material.

Thus does the Apollonian wrest us from Dionysian universality and fill
us with rapture for individuals; to these it rivets our sympathetic
emotion, through these it satisfies the sense of beauty which longs for
great and sublime forms; it brings before us biographical portraits,
and incites us to a thoughtful apprehension of the essence of life
contained therein. With the immense potency of the image, the concept,
the ethical teaching and the sympathetic emotion--the Apollonian
influence uplifts man from his orgiastic self-annihilation, and
beguiles him concerning the universality of the Dionysian process
into the belief that he is seeing a detached picture of the world,
for instance, Tristan and Isolde, and that, _through music,_ he will
be enabled to _see_ it still more clearly and intrinsically. What can
the healing magic of Apollo not accomplish when it can even excite in
us the illusion that the Dionysian is actually in the service of the
Apollonian, the effects of which it is capable of enhancing; yea, that
music is essentially the representative art for an Apollonian substance?

With the pre-established harmony which obtains between perfect drama
and its music, the drama attains the highest degree of conspicuousness,
such as is usually unattainable in mere spoken drama. As all the
animated figures of the scene in the independently evolved lines
of melody simplify themselves before us to the distinctness of the
catenary curve, the coexistence of these lines is also audible in the
harmonic change which sympathises in a most delicate manner with the
evolved process: through which change the relations of things become
immediately perceptible to us in a sensible and not at all abstract
manner, as we likewise perceive thereby that it is only in these
relations that the essence of a character and of a line of melody
manifests itself clearly. And while music thus compels us to see more
extensively and more intrinsically than usual, and makes us spread out
the curtain of the scene before ourselves like some delicate texture,
the world of the stage is as infinitely expanded for our spiritualised,
introspective eye as it is illumined outwardly from within. How can
the word-poet furnish anything analogous, who strives to attain this
internal expansion and illumination of the visible stage-world by a
much more imperfect mechanism and an indirect path, proceeding as he
does from word and concept? Albeit musical tragedy likewise avails
itself of the word, it is at the same time able to place alongside
thereof its basis and source, and can make the unfolding of the word,
from within outwards, obvious to us.

Of the process just set forth, however, it could still be said
as decidedly that it is only a glorious appearance, namely the
afore-mentioned Apollonian _illusion,_ through the influence of which
we are to be delivered from the Dionysian obtrusion and excess.
In point of fact, the relation of music to drama is precisely the
reverse; music is the adequate idea of the world, drama is but the
reflex of this idea, a detached umbrage thereof. The identity between
the line of melody and the lining form, between the harmony and the
character-relations of this form, is true in a sense antithetical to
what one would suppose on the contemplation of musical tragedy. We
may agitate and enliven the form in the most conspicuous manner, and
enlighten it from within, but it still continues merely phenomenon,
from which there is no bridge to lead us into the true reality, into
the heart of the world. Music, however, speaks out of this heart; and
though countless phenomena of the kind might be passing manifestations
of this music, they could never exhaust its essence, but would always
be merely its externalised copies. Of course, as regards the intricate
relation of music and drama, nothing can be explained, while all may
be confused by the popular and thoroughly false antithesis of soul and
body; but the unphilosophical crudeness of this antithesis seems to
have become--who knows for what reasons--a readily accepted Article of
Faith with our æstheticians, while they have learned nothing concerning
an antithesis of phenomenon and thing-in-itself, or perhaps, for
reasons equally unknown, have not cared to learn anything thereof.

Should it have been established by our analysis that the Apollonian
element in tragedy has by means of its illusion gained a complete
victory over the Dionysian primordial element of music, and has made
music itself subservient to its end, namely, the highest and clearest
elucidation of the drama, it would certainly be necessary to add the
very important restriction: that at the most essential point this
Apollonian illusion is dissolved and annihilated. The drama, which, by
the aid of music, spreads out before us with such inwardly illumined
distinctness in all its movements and figures, that we imagine we
see the texture unfolding on the loom as the shuttle flies to and
fro,--attains as a whole an effect which _transcends all Apollonian
artistic effects._ In the collective effect of tragedy, the Dionysian
gets the upper hand once more; tragedy ends with a sound which could
never emanate from the realm of Apollonian art. And the Apollonian
illusion is thereby found to be what it is,--the assiduous veiling
during the performance of tragedy of the intrinsically Dionysian
effect: which, however, is so powerful, that it finally forces
the Apollonian drama itself into a sphere where it begins to talk
with Dionysian wisdom, and even denies itself and its Apollonian
conspicuousness. Thus then the intricate relation of the Apollonian and
the Dionysian in tragedy must really be symbolised by a fraternal union
of the two deities: Dionysus speaks the language of Apollo; Apollo,
however, finally speaks the language of Dionysus; and so the highest
goal of tragedy and of art in general is attained.



22.


Let the attentive friend picture to himself purely and simply,
according to his experiences, the effect of a true musical tragedy. I
think I have so portrayed the phenomenon of this effect in both its
phases that he will now be able to interpret his own experiences. For
he will recollect that with regard to the myth which passed before
him he felt himself exalted to a kind of omniscience, as if his
visual faculty were no longer merely a surface faculty, but capable
of penetrating into the interior, and as if he now saw before him,
with the aid of music, the ebullitions of the will, the conflict of
motives, and the swelling stream of the passions, almost sensibly
visible, like a plenitude of actively moving lines and figures, and
could thereby dip into the most tender secrets of unconscious emotions.
While he thus becomes conscious of the highest exaltation of his
instincts for conspicuousness and transfiguration, he nevertheless
feels with equal definitiveness that this long series of Apollonian
artistic effects still does _not_ generate the blissful continuance in
will-less contemplation which the plasticist and the epic poet, that
is to say, the strictly Apollonian artists, produce in him by their
artistic productions: to wit, the justification of the world of the
_individuatio_ attained in this contemplation,--which is the object
and essence of Apollonian art. He beholds the transfigured world of
the stage and nevertheless denies it. He sees before him the tragic
hero in epic clearness and beauty, and nevertheless delights in his
annihilation. He comprehends the incidents of the scene in all their
details, and yet loves to flee into the incomprehensible. He feels the
actions of the hero to be justified, and is nevertheless still more
elated when these actions annihilate their originator. He shudders at
the sufferings which will befall the hero, and yet anticipates therein
a higher and much more overpowering joy. He sees more extensively and
profoundly than ever, and yet wishes to be blind. Whence must we derive
this curious internal dissension, this collapse of the Apollonian apex,
if not from the _Dionysian_ spell, which, though apparently stimulating
the Apollonian emotions to their highest pitch, can nevertheless force
this superabundance of Apollonian power into its service? _Tragic
myth_ is to be understood only as a symbolisation of Dionysian wisdom
by means of the expedients of Apollonian art: the mythus conducts the
world of phenomena to its boundaries, where it denies itself, and seeks
to flee back again into the bosom of the true and only reality; where
it then, like Isolde, seems to strike up its metaphysical swan-song:--

    In des Wonnemeeres
    wogendem Schwall,
    in der Duft-Wellen
    tönendem Schall,
    in des Weltathems
    wehendem All--
    ertrinken--versinken
    unbewusst--höchste Lust![24]

We thus realise to ourselves in the experiences of the truly æsthetic
hearer the tragic artist himself when he proceeds like a luxuriously
fertile divinity of individuation to create his figures (in which sense
his work can hardly be understood as an "imitation of nature")--and
when, on the other hand, his vast Dionysian impulse then absorbs the
entire world of phenomena, in order to anticipate beyond it, and
through its annihilation, the highest artistic primal joy, in the bosom
of the Primordial Unity. Of course, our æsthetes have nothing to say
about this return in fraternal union of the two art-deities to the
original home, nor of either the Apollonian or Dionysian excitement
of the hearer, while they are indefatigable in characterising the
struggle of the hero with fate, the triumph of the moral order of the
world, or the disburdenment of the emotions through tragedy, as the
properly Tragic: an indefatigableness which makes me think that they
are perhaps not æsthetically excitable men at all, but only to be
regarded as moral beings when hearing tragedy. Never since Aristotle
has an explanation of the tragic effect been proposed, by which an
æsthetic activity of the hearer could be inferred from artistic
circumstances. At one time fear and pity are supposed to be forced to
an alleviating discharge through the serious procedure, at another time
we are expected to feel elevated and inspired at the triumph of good
and noble principles, at the sacrifice of the hero in the interest of
a moral conception of things; and however certainly I believe that for
countless men precisely this, and only this, is the effect of tragedy,
it as obviously follows therefrom that all these, together with their
interpreting æsthetes, have had no experience of tragedy as the highest
_art._ The pathological discharge, the catharsis of Aristotle, which
philologists are at a loss whether to include under medicinal or moral
phenomena, recalls a remarkable anticipation of Goethe. "Without a
lively pathological interest," he says, "I too have never yet succeeded
in elaborating a tragic situation of any kind, and hence I have rather
avoided than sought it. Can it perhaps have been still another of the
merits of the ancients that the deepest pathos was with them merely
æsthetic play, whereas with us the truth of nature must co-operate in
order to produce such a work?" We can now answer in the affirmative
this latter profound question after our glorious experiences, in which
we have found to our astonishment in the case of musical tragedy
itself, that the deepest pathos can in reality be merely æsthetic play:
and therefore we are justified in believing that now for the first time
the proto-phenomenon of the tragic can be portrayed with some degree
of success. He who now will still persist in talking only of those
vicarious effects proceeding from ultra-æsthetic spheres, and does not
feel himself raised above the pathologically-moral process, may be left
to despair of his æsthetic nature: for which we recommend to him, by
way of innocent equivalent, the interpretation of Shakespeare after the
fashion of Gervinus, and the diligent search for poetic justice.

Thus with the re-birth of tragedy the _æsthetic hearer_ is also
born anew, in whose place in the theatre a curious _quid pro quo_
was wont to sit with half-moral and half-learned pretensions,--the
"critic." In his sphere hitherto everything has been artificial and
merely glossed over with a semblance of life. The performing artist
was in fact at a loss what to do with such a critically comporting
hearer, and hence he, as well as the dramatist or operatic composer
who inspired him, searched anxiously for the last remains of life
in a being so pretentiously barren and incapable of enjoyment. Such
"critics," however, have hitherto constituted the public; the student,
the school-boy, yea, even the most harmless womanly creature, were
already unwittingly prepared by education and by journals for a similar
perception of works of art. The nobler natures among the artists
counted upon exciting the moral-religious forces in such a public,
and the appeal to a moral order of the world operated vicariously,
when in reality some powerful artistic spell should have enraptured
the true hearer. Or again, some imposing or at all events exciting
tendency of the contemporary political and social world was presented
by the dramatist with such vividness that the hearer could forget his
critical exhaustion and abandon himself to similar emotions, as, in
patriotic or warlike moments, before the tribune of parliament, or
at the condemnation of crime and vice:--an estrangement of the true
aims of art which could not but lead directly now and then to a cult
of tendency. But here there took place what has always taken place
in the case of factitious arts, an extraordinary rapid depravation
of these tendencies, so that for instance the tendency to employ the
theatre as a means for the moral education of the people, which in
Schiller's time was taken seriously, is already reckoned among the
incredible antiquities of a surmounted culture. While the critic got
the upper hand in the theatre and concert-hall, the journalist in the
school, and the press in society, art degenerated into a topic of
conversation of the most trivial kind, and æsthetic criticism was used
as the cement of a vain, distracted, selfish and moreover piteously
unoriginal sociality, the significance of which is suggested by the
Schopenhauerian parable of the porcupines, so that there has never
been so much gossip about art and so little esteem for it. But is it
still possible to have intercourse with a man capable of conversing on
Beethoven or Shakespeare? Let each answer this question according to
his sentiments: he will at any rate show by his answer his conception
of "culture," provided he tries at least to answer the question, and
has not already grown mute with astonishment.

On the other hand, many a one more nobly and delicately endowed by
nature, though he may have gradually become a critical barbarian
in the manner described, could tell of the unexpected as well as
totally unintelligible effect which a successful performance of
_Lohengrin,_ for example, exerted on him: except that perhaps every
warning and interpreting hand was lacking to guide him; so that the
incomprehensibly heterogeneous and altogether incomparable sensation
which then affected him also remained isolated and became extinct, like
a mysterious star after a brief brilliancy. He then divined what the
æsthetic hearer is.

    In the sea of pleasure's
    Billowing roll,
    In the ether-waves
    Knelling and toll,
    In the world-breath's
    Wavering whole--
    To drown in, go down in--
    Lost in swoon--greatest boon!



23.


He who wishes to test himself rigorously as to how he is related to the
true æsthetic hearer, or whether he belongs rather to the community
of the Socrato-critical man, has only to enquire sincerely concerning
the sentiment with which he accepts the _wonder_ represented on the
stage: whether he feels his historical sense, which insists on strict
psychological causality, insulted by it, whether with benevolent
concession he as it were admits the wonder as a phenomenon intelligible
to childhood, but relinquished by him, or whether he experiences
anything else thereby. For he will thus be enabled to determine how
far he is on the whole capable of understanding _myth,_ that is to
say, the concentrated picture of the world, which, as abbreviature of
phenomena, cannot dispense with wonder. It is probable, however, that
nearly every one, upon close examination, feels so disintegrated by
the critico-historical spirit of our culture, that he can only perhaps
make the former existence of myth credible to himself by learned
means through intermediary abstractions. Without myth, however, every
culture loses its healthy, creative natural power: it is only a horizon
encompassed with myths which rounds off to unity a social movement.
It is only by myth that all the powers of the imagination and of the
Apollonian dream are freed from their random rovings. The mythical
figures have to be the invisibly omnipresent genii, under the care of
which the young soul grows to maturity, by the signs of which the man
gives a meaning to his life and struggles: and the state itself knows
no more powerful unwritten law than the mythical foundation which
vouches for its connection with religion and its growth from mythical
ideas.

Let us now place alongside thereof the abstract man proceeding
independently of myth, the abstract education, the abstract usage,
the abstract right, the abstract state: let us picture to ourselves
the lawless roving of the artistic imagination, not bridled by any
native myth: let us imagine a culture which has no fixed and sacred
primitive seat, but is doomed to exhaust all its possibilities, and
has to nourish itself wretchedly from the other cultures--such is the
Present, as the result of Socratism, which is bent on the destruction
of myth. And now the myth-less man remains eternally hungering among
all the bygones, and digs and grubs for roots, though he have to dig
for them even among the remotest antiquities. The stupendous historical
exigency of the unsatisfied modern culture, the gathering around one of
countless other cultures, the consuming desire for knowledge--what does
all this point to, if not to the loss of myth, the loss of the mythical
home, the mythical source? Let us ask ourselves whether the feverish
and so uncanny stirring of this culture is aught but the eager seizing
and snatching at food of the hungerer--and who would care to contribute
anything more to a culture which cannot be appeased by all it devours,
and in contact with which the most vigorous and wholesome nourishment
is wont to change into "history and criticism"?

We should also have to regard our German character with despair and
sorrow, if it had already become inextricably entangled in, or even
identical with this culture, in a similar manner as we can observe it
to our horror to be the case in civilised France; and that which for
a long time was the great advantage of France and the cause of her
vast preponderance, to wit, this very identity of people and culture,
might compel us at the sight thereof to congratulate ourselves that
this culture of ours, which is so questionable, has hitherto had
nothing in common with the noble kernel of the character of our people.
All our hopes, on the contrary, stretch out longingly towards the
perception that beneath this restlessly palpitating civilised life and
educational convulsion there is concealed a glorious, intrinsically
healthy, primeval power, which, to be sure, stirs vigorously only at
intervals in stupendous moments, and then dreams on again in view of
a future awakening. It is from this abyss that the German Reformation
came forth: in the choral-hymn of which the future melody of German
music first resounded. So deep, courageous, and soul-breathing, so
exuberantly good and tender did this chorale of Luther sound,--as the
first Dionysian-luring call which breaks forth from dense thickets
at the approach of spring. To it responded with emulative echo the
solemnly wanton procession of Dionysian revellers, to whom we are
indebted for German music--and to whom we shall be indebted for _the
re-birth of German myth._

I know that I must now lead the sympathising and attentive friend to
an elevated position of lonesome contemplation, where he will have
but few companions, and I call out encouragingly to him that we must
hold fast to our shining guides, the Greeks. For the rectification
of our æsthetic knowledge we previously borrowed from them the two
divine figures, each of which sways a separate realm of art, and
concerning whose mutual contact and exaltation we have acquired a
notion through Greek tragedy. Through a remarkable disruption of both
these primitive artistic impulses, the ruin of Greek tragedy seemed
to be necessarily brought about: with which process a degeneration
and a transmutation of the Greek national character was strictly in
keeping, summoning us to earnest reflection as to how closely and
necessarily art and the people, myth and custom, tragedy and the state,
have coalesced in their bases. The ruin of tragedy was at the same
time the ruin of myth. Until then the Greeks had been involuntarily
compelled immediately to associate all experiences with their myths,
indeed they had to comprehend them only through this association:
whereby even the most immediate present necessarily appeared to them
_sub specie æterni_ and in a certain sense as timeless. Into this
current of the timeless, however, the state as well as art plunged
in order to find repose from the burden and eagerness of the moment.
And a people--for the rest, also a man--is worth just as much only as
its ability to impress on its experiences the seal of eternity: for
it is thus, as it were, desecularised, and reveals its unconscious
inner conviction of the relativity of time and of the true, that is,
the metaphysical significance of life. The contrary happens when a
people begins to comprehend itself historically and to demolish the
mythical bulwarks around it: with which there is usually connected
a marked secularisation, a breach with the unconscious metaphysics
of its earlier existence, in all ethical consequences. Greek art and
especially Greek tragedy delayed above all the annihilation of myth:
it was necessary to annihilate these also to be able to live detached
from the native soil, unbridled in the wilderness of thought, custom,
and action. Even in such circumstances this metaphysical impulse still
endeavours to create for itself a form of apotheosis (weakened, no
doubt) in the Socratism of science urging to life: but on its lower
stage this same impulse led only to a feverish search, which gradually
merged into a pandemonium of myths and superstitions accumulated from
all quarters: in the midst of which, nevertheless, the Hellene sat with
a yearning heart till he contrived, as Græculus, to mask his fever with
Greek cheerfulness and Greek levity, or to narcotise himself completely
with some gloomy Oriental superstition.

We have approached this condition in the most striking manner since the
reawakening of the Alexandro--Roman antiquity in the fifteenth century,
after a long, not easily describable, interlude. On the heights there
is the same exuberant love of knowledge, the same insatiate happiness
of the discoverer, the same stupendous secularisation, and, together
with these, a homeless roving about, an eager intrusion at foreign
tables, a frivolous deification of the present or a dull senseless
estrangement, all _sub speci sæculi,_ of the present time: which
same symptoms lead one to infer the same defect at the heart of
this culture, the annihilation of myth. It seems hardly possible to
transplant a foreign myth with permanent success, without dreadfully
injuring the tree through this transplantation: which is perhaps
occasionally strong enough and sound enough to eliminate the foreign
element after a terrible struggle; but must ordinarily consume itself
in a languishing and stunted condition or in sickly luxuriance. Our
opinion of the pure and vigorous kernel of the German being is such
that we venture to expect of it, and only of it, this elimination of
forcibly ingrafted foreign elements, and we deem it possible that
the German spirit will reflect anew on itself. Perhaps many a one
will be of opinion that this spirit must begin its struggle with the
elimination of the Romanic element: for which it might recognise an
external preparation and encouragement in the victorious bravery and
bloody glory of the late war, but must seek the inner constraint in the
emulative zeal to be for ever worthy of the sublime protagonists on
this path, of Luther as well as our great artists and poets. But let
him never think he can fight such battles without his household gods,
without his mythical home, without a "restoration" of all German things
I And if the German should look timidly around for a guide to lead
him back to his long-lost home, the ways and paths of which he knows
no longer--let him but listen to the delightfully luring call of the
Dionysian bird, which hovers above him, and would fain point out to him
the way thither.

Among the peculiar artistic effects of musical tragedy we had to
emphasise an Apollonian _illusion,_ through which we are to be saved
from immediate oneness with the Dionysian music, while our musical
excitement is able to discharge itself on an Apollonian domain and
in an interposed visible middle world. It thereby seemed to us that
precisely through this discharge the middle world of theatrical
procedure, the drama generally, became visible and intelligible from
within in a degree unattainable in the other forms of Apollonian art:
so that here, where this art was as it were winged and borne aloft by
the spirit of music, we had to recognise the highest exaltation of its
powers, and consequently in the fraternal union of Apollo and Dionysus
the climax of the Apollonian as well as of the Dionysian artistic aims.

Of course, the Apollonian light-picture did not, precisely with this
inner illumination through music, attain the peculiar effect of the
weaker grades of Apollonian art. What the epos and the animated stone
can do--constrain the contemplating eye to calm delight in the world
of the _individuatio_--could not be realised here, notwithstanding
the greater animation and distinctness. We contemplated the drama
and penetrated with piercing glance into its inner agitated world of
motives--and yet it seemed as if only a symbolic picture passed before
us, the profoundest significance of which we almost believed we had
divined, and which we desired to put aside like a curtain in order to
behold the original behind it. The greatest distinctness of the picture
did not suffice us: for it seemed to reveal as well as veil something;
and while it seemed, with its symbolic revelation, to invite the
rending of the veil for the disclosure of the mysterious background,
this illumined all-conspicuousness itself enthralled the eye and
prevented it from penetrating more deeply He who has not experienced
this,--to have to view, and at the same time to have a longing
beyond the viewing,--will hardly be able to conceive how clearly and
definitely these two processes coexist in the contemplation of tragic
myth and are felt to be conjoined; while the truly æsthetic spectators
will confirm my assertion that among the peculiar effects of tragedy
this conjunction is the most noteworthy. Now let this phenomenon of the
æsthetic spectator be transferred to an analogous process in the tragic
artist, and the genesis of _tragic myth_ will have been understood. It
shares with the Apollonian sphere of art the full delight in appearance
and contemplation, and at the same time it denies this delight and
finds a still higher satisfaction in the annihilation of the visible
world of appearance. The substance of tragic myth is first of all an
epic event involving the glorification of the fighting hero: but whence
originates the essentially enigmatical trait, that the suffering in
the fate of the hero, the most painful victories, the most agonising
contrasts of motives, in short, the exemplification of the wisdom of
Silenus, or, æsthetically expressed, the Ugly and Discordant, is always
represented anew in such countless forms with such predilection, and
precisely in the most youthful and exuberant age of a people, unless
there is really a higher delight experienced in all this?

For the fact that things actually take such a tragic course would
least of all explain the origin of a form of art; provided that art
is not merely an imitation of the reality of nature, but in truth a
metaphysical supplement to the reality of nature, placed alongside
thereof for its conquest. Tragic myth, in so far as it really belongs
to art, also fully participates in this transfiguring metaphysical
purpose of art in general: What does it transfigure, however, when it
presents the phenomenal world in the guise of the suffering hero? Least
of all the "reality" of this phenomenal world, for it says to us: "Look
at this! Look carefully! It is your life! It is the hour-hand of your
clock of existence!"

And myth has displayed this life, in order thereby to transfigure it
to us? If not, how shall we account for the æsthetic pleasure with
which we make even these representations pass before us? I am inquiring
concerning the æsthetic pleasure, and am well aware that many of
these representations may moreover occasionally create even a moral
delectation, say under the form of pity or of a moral triumph. But he
who would derive the effect of the tragic exclusively from these moral
sources, as was usually the case far too long in æsthetics, let him not
think that he has done anything for Art thereby; for Art must above all
insist on purity in her domain. For the explanation of tragic myth the
very first requirement is that the pleasure which characterises it must
be sought in the purely æsthetic sphere, without encroaching on the
domain of pity, fear, or the morally-sublime. How can the ugly and the
discordant, the substance of tragic myth, excite an æsthetic pleasure?

Here it is necessary to raise ourselves with a daring bound into a
metaphysics of Art. I repeat, therefore, my former proposition, that
it is only as an æsthetic phenomenon that existence and the world,
appear justified: and in this sense it is precisely the function of
tragic myth to convince us that even the Ugly and Discordant is an
artistic game which the will, in the eternal fulness of its joy, plays
with itself. But this not easily comprehensible proto-phenomenon of
Dionysian Art becomes, in a direct way, singularly intelligible, and
is immediately apprehended in the wonderful significance of _musical
dissonance:_ just as in general it is music alone, placed in contrast
to the world, which can give us an idea as to what is meant by the
justification of the world as an æsthetic phenomenon. The joy that the
tragic myth excites has the same origin as the joyful sensation of
dissonance in music. The Dionysian, with its primitive joy experienced
in pain itself, is the common source of music and tragic myth.

Is it not possible that by calling to our aid the musical relation of
dissonance, the difficult problem of tragic effect may have meanwhile
been materially facilitated? For we now understand what it means to
wish to view tragedy and at the same time to have a longing beyond the
viewing: a frame of mind, which, as regards the artistically employed
dissonance, we should simply have to characterise by saying that we
desire to hear and at the same time have a longing beyond the hearing.
That striving for the infinite, the pinion-flapping of longing,
accompanying the highest delight in the clearly-perceived reality,
remind one that in both states we have to recognise a Dionysian
phenomenon, which again and again reveals to us anew the playful
up-building and demolishing of the world of individuals as the efflux
of a primitive delight, in like manner as when Heraclitus the Obscure
compares the world-building power to a playing child which places
stones here and there and builds sandhills only to overthrow them again.

Hence, in order to form a true estimate of the Dionysian capacity of
a people, it would seem that we must think not only of their music,
but just as much of their tragic myth, the second witness of this
capacity. Considering this most intimate relationship between music
and myth, we may now in like manner suppose that a degeneration and
depravation of the one involves a deterioration of the other: if it be
true at all that the weakening of the myth is generally expressive of
a debilitation of the Dionysian capacity. Concerning both, however,
a glance at the development of the German genius should not leave
us in any doubt; in the opera just as in the abstract character of
our myth-less existence, in an art sunk to pastime just as in a life
guided by concepts, the inartistic as well as life-consuming nature
of Socratic optimism had revealed itself to us. Yet there have been
indications to console us that nevertheless in some inaccessible abyss
the German spirit still rests and dreams, undestroyed, in glorious
health, profundity, and Dionysian strength, like a knight sunk in
slumber: from which abyss the Dionysian song rises to us to let us
know that this German knight even still dreams his primitive Dionysian
myth in blissfully earnest visions. Let no one believe that the German
spirit has for ever lost its mythical home when it still understands so
obviously the voices of the birds which tell of that home. Some day it
will find itself awake in all the morning freshness of a deep sleep:
then it will slay the dragons, destroy the malignant dwarfs, and waken
Brünnhilde--and Wotan's spear itself will be unable to obstruct its
course!

My friends, ye who believe in Dionysian music, ye know also what
tragedy means to us. There we have tragic myth, born anew from
music,--and in this latest birth ye can hope for everything and forget
what is most afflicting. What is most afflicting to all of us, however,
is--the prolonged degradation in which the German genius has lived
estranged from house and home in the service of malignant dwarfs. Ye
understand my allusion--as ye will also, in conclusion, understand my
hopes.



25.


Music and tragic myth are equally the expression of the Dionysian
capacity of a people, and are inseparable from each other. Both
originate in an ultra Apollonian sphere of art; both transfigure a
region in the delightful accords of which all dissonance, just like
the terrible picture of the world, dies charmingly away; both play
with the sting of displeasure, trusting to their most potent magic;
both justify thereby the existence even of the "worst world." Here
the Dionysian, as compared with the Apollonian, exhibits itself as
the eternal and original artistic force, which in general calls into
existence the entire world of phenomena: in the midst of which a new
transfiguring appearance becomes necessary, in order to keep alive the
animated world of individuation. If we could conceive an incarnation
of dissonance--and what is man but that?--then, to be able to live
this dissonance would require a glorious illusion which would spread
a veil of beauty over its peculiar nature. This is the true function
of Apollo as deity of art: in whose name we comprise all the countless
manifestations of the fair realm of illusion, which each moment render
life in general worth living and make one impatient for the experience
of the next moment.

At the same time, just as much of this basis of all existence--the
Dionysian substratum of the world--is allowed to enter into the
consciousness of human beings, as can be surmounted again by the
Apollonian transfiguring power, so that these two art-impulses are
constrained to develop their powers in strictly mutual proportion,
according to the law of eternal justice. When the Dionysian powers rise
with such vehemence as we experience at present, there can be no doubt
that, veiled in a cloud, Apollo has already descended to us; whose
grandest beautifying influences a coming generation will perhaps behold.

That this effect is necessary, however, each one would most surely
perceive by intuition, if once he found himself carried back--even in
a dream--into an Old-Hellenic existence. In walking under high Ionic
colonnades, looking upwards to a horizon defined by clear and noble
lines, with reflections of his transfigured form by his side in shining
marble, and around him solemnly marching or quietly moving men, with
harmoniously sounding voices and rhythmical pantomime, would he not in
the presence of this perpetual influx of beauty have to raise his hand
to Apollo and exclaim: "Blessed race of Hellenes! How great Dionysus
must be among you, when the Delian god deems such charms necessary
to cure you of your dithyrambic madness!"--To one in this frame of
mind, however, an aged Athenian, looking up to him with the sublime
eye of Æschylus, might answer: "Say also this, thou curious stranger:
what sufferings this people must have undergone, in order to be able
to become thus beautiful! But now follow me to a tragic play, and
sacrifice with me in the temple of both the deities!"




APPENDIX.


[Late in the year 1888, not long before he was overcome by his sudden
attack of insanity, Nietzsche wrote down a few notes concerning
his early work, the _Birth of Tragedy._ These were printed in his
sister's biography (_Das Leben Friedrich Nietzsches,_ vol. ii. pt.
i. pp. 102 ff.), and are here translated as likely to be of interest
to readers of this remarkable work. They also appear in the _Ecce
Homo._--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.]

"To be just to the _Birth of Tragedy_(1872), one will have to forget
some few things. It has _wrought effects,_ it even fascinated through
that wherein it was amiss--through its application to _Wagnerism,_
just as if this Wagnerism were symptomatic of _a rise and going up._
And just on that account was the book an event in Wagner's life: from
thence and only from thence were great hopes linked to the name of
Wagner. Even to-day people remind me, sometimes right in the midst of
a talk on _Parsifal,_ that _I_ and none other have it on my conscience
that such a high opinion of the _cultural value_ of this movement came
to the top. More than once have I found the book referred to as 'the
_Re_-birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music': one only had an ear
for a new formula of _Wagner's_ art, aim, task,--and failed to hear
withal what was at bottom valuable therein. 'Hellenism and Pessimism'
had been a more unequivocal title: namely, as a first lesson on the
way in which the Greeks got the better of pessimism,--on the means
whereby they _overcame_ it. Tragedy simply proves that the Greeks were
_no_ pessimists: Schopenhauer was mistaken here as he was mistaken
in all other things. Considered with some neutrality, the _Birth of
Tragedy_ appears very unseasonable: one would not even dream that
it was _begun_ amid the thunders of the battle of Wörth. I thought
these problems through and through before the walls of Metz in cold
September nights, in the midst of the work of nursing the sick; one
might even believe the book to be fifty years older. It is politically
indifferent--un-German one will say to-day,--it smells shockingly
Hegelian, in but a few formulæ does it scent of Schopenhauer's
funereal perfume. An 'idea'--the antithesis of 'Dionysian _versus_
Apollonian'--translated into metaphysics; history itself as the
evolution of this 'idea'; the antithesis dissolved into oneness
in Tragedy; through this optics things that had never yet looked
into one another's face, confronted of a sudden, and illumined and
_comprehended_ through one another: for instance, Opera and Revolution.
The two decisive _innovations_ of the book are, on the one hand, the
comprehension of the _Dionysian_ phenomenon among the Greeks (it gives
the first psychology thereof, it sees therein the One root of all
Grecian art); on the other, the comprehension of Socratism: Socrates
diagnosed for the first time as the tool of Grecian dissolution, as
a typical decadent. 'Rationality' _against_ instinct! 'Rationality'
at any price as a dangerous, as a life-undermining force! Throughout
the whole book a deep hostile silence on Christianity: it is neither
Apollonian nor Dionysian; it _negatives_ all _æsthetic_ values (the
only values recognised by the _Birth of Tragedy),_ it is in the widest
sense nihilistic, whereas in the Dionysian symbol the utmost limit
of _affirmation_ is reached. Once or twice the Christian priests are
alluded to as a 'malignant kind of dwarfs,' as 'subterraneans.'"



2.


"This beginning is singular beyond measure. I had for my own inmost
experience _discovered_ the only symbol and counterpart of history,--I
had just thereby been the first to grasp the wonderful phenomenon
of the Dionysian. And again, through my diagnosing Socrates as a
decadent, I had given a wholly unequivocal proof of how little risk
the trustworthiness of my psychological grasp would run of being
weakened by some moralistic idiosyncrasy--to view morality itself as a
symptom of decadence is an innovation, a novelty of the first rank in
the history of knowledge. How far I had leaped in either case beyond
the smug shallow-pate-gossip of optimism _contra_ pessimism! I was
the first to see the intrinsic antithesis: here, the _degenerating_
instinct which, with subterranean vindictiveness, turns against life
(Christianity, the philosophy of Schopenhauer, in a certain sense
already the philosophy of Plato, all idealistic systems as typical
forms), and there, a formula of _highest affirmation,_ born of fullness
and overfullness, a yea-saying without reserve to suffering's self,
to guilt's self, to all that is questionable and strange in existence
itself. This final, cheerfullest, exuberantly mad-and-merriest Yea to
life is not only the highest insight, it is also the _deepest,_ it
is that which is most rigorously confirmed and upheld by truth and
science. Naught that is, is to be deducted, naught is dispensable; the
phases of existence rejected by the Christians and other nihilists are
even of an infinitely higher order in the hierarchy of values than
that which the instinct of decadence sanctions, yea durst _sanction._
To comprehend this _courage_ is needed, and, as a condition thereof, a
surplus of _strength_: for precisely in degree as courage _dares_ to
thrust forward, precisely according to the measure of strength, does
one approach truth. Perception, the yea-saying to reality, is as much
a necessity to the strong as to the weak, under the inspiration of
weakness, cowardly shrinking, and _flight_ from reality--the 'ideal.'
... They are not free to perceive: the decadents have _need_ of the
lie,--it is one of their conditions of self-preservation. Whoso not
only comprehends the word Dionysian, but also grasps his _self_ in
this word, requires no refutation of Plato or of Christianity or of
Schopenhauer--_he smells the putrefaction._"

"To what extent I had just thereby found the concept 'tragic,' the
definitive perception of the psychology of tragedy, I have but lately
stated in the _Twilight of the Idols,_ page 139 (1st edit.): 'The
affirmation of life, even in its most unfamiliar and severe problems,
the will to life, enjoying its own inexhaustibility in the sacrifice
of its highest types,--_that_ is what I called Dionysian, that is
what I divined as the bridge to a psychology of the _tragic_ poet.
Not in order to get rid of terror and pity, not to purify from a
dangerous passion by its vehement discharge (it was thus that Aristotle
misunderstood it); but, beyond terror and pity, _to realise in fact_
the eternal delight of becoming, that delight which even involves in
itself the _joy of annihilating!_[1] In this sense I have the right
to understand myself to be the first _tragic philosopher_--that is,
the utmost antithesis and antipode to a pessimistic philosopher. Prior
to myself there is no such translation of the Dionysian into the
philosophic pathos: there lacks the _tragic wisdom,_--I have sought
in vain for an indication thereof even among the _great_ Greeks of
philosophy, the thinkers of the two centuries _before_ Socrates. A
doubt still possessed me as touching _Heraclitus,_ in whose proximity
I in general begin to feel warmer and better than anywhere else. The
affirmation of transiency _and annihilation,_ to wit the decisive
factor in a Dionysian _philosophy,_ the yea-saying to antithesis
and war, to _becoming,_ with radical rejection even of the concept
'_being,_'--that I must directly acknowledge as, of all thinking
hitherto, the nearest to my own. The doctrine of 'eternal recurrence,'
that is, of the unconditioned and infinitely repeated cycle of all
things--this doctrine of Zarathustra's _might_ after all have been
already taught by Heraclitus. At any rate the portico[2] which
inherited well-nigh all its fundamental conceptions from Heraclitus,
shows traces thereof."INTRODUCTION 

Even among the Greeks, it was the individuals that counted. 

"The Greeks are interesting and extremely important be 
cause they reared such a vast number of great individuals. How 
was this possible? The question is one which ought to be 
studied. 

"I am interested only in the relations of a people to the 
rearing of the individual man, and among the Greeks the 
conditions were unusually favorable for the development of 
che individual; not by any means owing to the goodness of the 
people, but because of the struggles of their evil instincts. 

With the help of favorable measures great individuals 
might be reared who ivould be both different from and higher 
than those who heretofore have owed their existence to mere 
chance. Here we may still be hopeful : in the rearing of excep 
tional men." 

The notion of rearing the Superman is only a new form of 
an ideal Nietzsche already had in his youth, that "the object 
of mankind should lie in its highest individuals" (or, as he 
writes in "Schopenhauer as Educator": "Mankind ought con 
stantly to be striving to produce great men this and nothing 
else is its duty." ) . But the ideals he most revered in those days 
are no longer held to be the highest types of men. No, around 
this future ideal of a coming humanity the Superman the 
poet spread the veil of becoming. Who can tell to what glorious 
heights man can still ascend? That is why, after having tested 
the worth of our noblest ideal that of the Saviour, in the 
light of the new valuations, the poet cries with passionate 
emphasis in "Zarathustra" : 

"Never yet hath there been a Superman. Naked have I seen 
both of them, the greatest and the smallest man: 

"All-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily even the 
greatest found I all-too-human!"

INTRODUCTION XI 

The phrase "the rearing of the Superman," has very often 
been misunderstood. By the word "rearing," in this case, is 
meant the act of modifying by means of new and higher values 
values which, as laws and guides of conduct and opinion, are 
now to rule over mankind. In general the doctrine of the 
Superman can only be understood correctly in conjunction with 
other ideas of the author s, such as: the Order of Rank, the 
Will to Power, and the Transvaluation of All Values. He 
assumes tha.t Christianity^ as a product of the resentment of 
the botched and the weak, has put in ban all that is beautiful, / 
strong, prou3, and powerful 1 * 1 ml ac"taff the qualities resulting 
from strength, and that, in consequence, all forces which tend 

promote or elevate" iTTe have been seriously undermined

however, a new table of valuations must be placed ove* "~ J 
mankind namely, that of the strong, mighty, and magnifi 
cent man, overflowing with life and elevated to his zenith the 
Superman^ who is now put before us with overpowering pas 
sion as the aim of our life, hope, and will. And just as the oldi 
system of valuing., which only extolled the qualities favorable 
to the weak, the suffering, and the oppressed, has succeeded in 
producing a weak, suffering, and "modern" race, so this new 
and reversed system of valuing ought to rear a healthy, strong, 
lively, and courageous type, which would be a glory to life 
itself. Stated briefly, the leading ; principle of this new system 
of valuing would be: "All that proceeds from power is good, 
all that springs from weakness is bad. 

This type must not be regarded as a fanciful figure: it is not 
a nebulous hope which is to be realized at some indefinitely 
remote period, thousands of years hence; nor is it a new species 
( in the Darwinian sense) of which we can know nothing, and 
which it would therefore be somewhat absurd to strive after, 
but it is meant tc be a possibility which men of the present 



Xll INTRODUCTION 

could realize with all their spiritual and physical energies, pro 
vided they adopted the new values. 

The author of "Zarathustra" never lost sight of that egre 
gious example of a transvaluation of all values through Chris 
tianity, whereby the whole of the deified mode of life and 
thought of the Greeks,, as well as strong Romedom, was almost 
annihilated or transvalued, in a comparatively short time. 
Could not a rejuvenated Grasco-Roman system of valuing 
(once it had been refined and made more profound by the 
schooling which two thousand years of Christianity had pro 
vided ) effect another such revolution within a calculable period 
of time, until that glorious type of manhood shall finally ap 
pear which is to be our new faith and hope, and in the creation 
of which Zarathustra exhorts us to participate? 

In his private notes on the subject the author uses the ex 
pression "Superman" (always in the singular, by-the-bye), as 
signifying "the most thoroughly well-constituted type," as 
opposed to "modern man"; above all, however, he designates 
Zarathustra himself as an example of the Superman. In "Ecce 
Homo" he is careful to enlighten us concerning the precursors 
and prerequisites to the advent of this highest type, in referring 
to a certain passage in "The Joyful Wisdom": 

"In order to understand this type, we must first be quite clear 
in regard to the leading physiological condition on which it 
depends: this condition is what I call great healthiness. I know 
not how to express my meaning more plainly or more per 
sonally than I have done already in one of the last chapters 
(Aphorism 382) of the fifth book of "The Joyful Wisdom": 

"We, the new, the nameless, the hard-to-imderstand" it says there 
"we firstlings of a yet untried future \ve require for a new end also a 
new means, namely, a new healthiness, stronger, sharper, tougher, bolder 
and merrier than all healthiness hitherto. He whose soul lungeth t*

experience the whole range of hitherto recognized values and desirabilities, 
and to circumnavigate all the coasts of this ideal Mediterranean Sea, 
who, from the adventures of his most personal experience, wants to know 
how it feels to be a conqueror, and discoverer of the ideal as likewise 
how it is with the artist, the saint, the legislator, the sage, the scholar, the 
devotee, the prophet, and the godly non-conformist of the old style 
requires one thing above all for that purpose, great healthiness such 
healthiness as one not only possesses, but also constantly acquires and must 
acquire, because one unceasingly sacrifices it again, and must sacrifice it! 
And now, after having been long on the way in this fashion, we Argo 
nauts of the ideal, more courageous perhaps than prudent, and often 
enough shipwrecked and brought to grief, nevertheless dangerously 
healthy, always healthy again it would seem as if, in recompense for 
it all, that we have a still undiscovered country before us, the boundaries 
of which no one has yet seen, a beyond to all countries and corners of 
the ideal known hitherto, a world so over-rich in the beautiful, the 
strange, the questionable, the frightful, and the divine, that our curiosity 
as well as our thirst for possession thereof, have got out of hand alas! 
rhat nothing will now any longer satisfy us! 

"How could we still be content with the man of the present day after 
such outlooks, and with such a craving in our conscience and conscious 
ness? Sad enough; but it is unavoidable that we should look on the 
worthiest aims and hopes of the man of the present day with ill-concealed 
amusement, and perhaps should no longer look at them. Another ideal 
runs on before us, a strange, tempting ideal full of danger, to which we 
should not like to persuade any one, because we do not so readily acknowl 
edge any one s right thereto: the ideal of a spirit who plays naively (that 
is to say involuntarily and from overflowing abundance and power) with 
everything that has hitherto been called holy, good, intangible, or divine; 
to whom the loftiest conception which the people have reasonably made 
their measure of value, would already practically imply danger, ruin, 
abasement, or at least relaxation, blindness, or temporary self-forgetful- 
ness; the ideal of a humanly superhuman welfare and benevolence, which 
will often enough appear inhuman, for example, when put alongside of 
all past seriousness on earth, and alongside of all past solemnities in bear 
ing, word, tone, look, morality, and pursuit, as their truest involuntary 
parody and with which, nevertheless, perhaps the great seriousness only

commences, when the proper interrogative mark is set up, the fate of the 
soul changes, the hour-hand moves, and tragedy begins. . . ." 

Although the figure of Zarathustra and a large number of 
the leading thoughts in this work had appeared much earliei 
in the dreams and writings of the author, "Thus Spake Zara 
thustra" did not actually come into being until the month of 
August, 1 88 1, in Sils-Maria; and it was the idea of the Eternal 
Recurrence of all things which finally induced my brother to 
set forth his new views in poetic language. In regard to his first 
conception of this idea, his autobiographical sketch, "Ecce, 
Homo," written in the autumn of 1888, contains the following 
passage: 

"The fundamental idea of my work namely, the Eternal 
Recurrence of all things this highest of all possible formulas 
of a Yea-saying philosophy, first occurred to me in August, 
1 88 1. I made a note of the thought on a sheet of paper, with 
the postscript: 6,000 feet beyond men and time! That day I 
happened to be wandering through the woods alongside of 
the lake of Silvaplana, and I halted beside a huge, pyramidal 
and towering rock not far from Surlei. It was then that the 
thought struck me. Looking back now, I find that exactly two 
months previous to this inspiration, I had had an omen of its 
coming in the form of a sudden and decisive alteration in my 
tastes more particularly in music. It would even be possible 
to consider all Zarathustra as a musical composition. At all 
events, a very necessary condition in its production was a 
renaissance in myself of the art of hearing. In a small mountain 
resort (Recoaro) near Vicenza, where I spent the spring of 
1 88 1, 1 and my friend and Maestro, Peter Cast also one who 
had been born again discovered that the phoenix music that 
hovered over us, wore lighter and brighter plumes than it had 
done theretofore." 



INTRODUCTION X* 

During the month of August, 1881, my brother resolved to 
reveal the teaching of the Eternal Recurrence, in dithyrambic 
and psalmodic form, through the mouth of Zarathustra. 
Among the notes of this period, we found a page on which is 
written the first definite plan of "Thus Spake Zarathustra": 

"MIDDAY AND ETERNITY." 
"GUIDE-POSTS TO A NEW WAY OF LIVING/ 
Beneath this is written: 

"Zarathustra born on lake Urmi; left his home in his thirtieth year, 
went into the province of Aria, and, during ten years of solitude in the 
mountains, composed the Zend-Avesta." 

"The sun of knowledge stands once more at midday; and the serpent 
of eternity lies coiled in its light : It is your time, ye midday brethren. 

In that summer of 1881, my brother, after many years of 
steadily declining health, began at last to rally, and it is to this 
first gush of the recovery of his once splendid bodily condition 
that we owe not only "The Joyful Wisdom," which in its mood 
may be regarded as a prelude to "Zarathustra," but also "Zara 
thustra" itself. Just as he was beginning to recuperate his 
health^ however, an unkind destiny brought him a number of 
most painful personal experiences. His friends caused him 
many disappointments, which were the more bitter to him, in 
asmuch as he regarded friendship as such a sacred institution; 
and for the first time in his life he realized the whole horror 
of that loneliness to which, perhaps, all greatness is con 
demned. But to be forsaken is something very different from 
deliberately choosing blessed loneliness. How he longed, in 
those days, for the ideal friend who would thoroughly under 
stand him, to whom he would be able to say all, and whom he 
imagined he had found at various periods in his life from his 



XVI INTRODUCTION 

earliest youth onwards. Now, however, that the way he had 
chosen grew ever more perilous and steep, he found nobody 
who could follow him: he therefore created a perfect friend 
for himself in the ideal form of a majestic philosopher, and 
made this creation the preacher of his gospel to the world. 

Whether my brother would ever have written "Thus Spake 
Zarathustra" according to the first plan sketched in the sum 
mer of 1 88 1, if he had not had the disappointments already 
referred to, is now an idle question; but perhaps where "Zara 
thustra" is concerned, we may also say with Master Eckhardt: 
"The fleetest beast to bear you to perfection is suffering." 

My brother writes as follows about the origin of the first 
part of "Zarathustra": "In the winter of 1882-83. I was 
living on the charming little Gulf of Rapallo, not far from 
Genoa, and between Chiavari and Cape Porto Fino. My health 
was not very good; the winter was cold and exceptionally rainy; 
and the small inn in which I lived was so close to the water 
that at night my sleep would be disturbed if the sea were high. 
These circumstances were surely the very reverse of favorable; 
and yet in spite of it all, and as if in demonstration of my belief 
that everything decisive comes to life in spite of every obstacle, 
it was precisely during this winter and in the midst of these un 
favorable circumstances that my Zarathustra originated. In 
the morning I used to start out in a southerly direction up the 
glorious road to Zoagli, which rises aloft through a forest of 
pines and gives one a view far out into the sea. In the after 
noon, as often as my health permitted, I walked round the 
whole bay from Santa Margherita to beyond Porto Fino. This 
spot was all the more interesting to me, inasmuch as it was so 
dearly loved by the Emperor Frederick III. In the autumn of 
1886 I chanced to be there again when he was revisiting this 
small, forgotten world of happiness for the last time. It was on 



INTRODUCTION 

these two roads that all Zarathustra came to me, above all 
Zarathustra himself as a type; I ought rather to say that it was 
on these walks that these ideas waylaid me." 

The first part of "Zarathustra" was written in about ten 
days that is to say, from the beginning to about the middle 
of February, 1883. "The last lines were written precisely in the 
hallowed hour when Richard Wagner gave up the ghost in 
Venice." 

With the exception of the ten days occupied in composing 
the first part of this book, my brother often referred to this 
winter as the hardest and sickliest he had ever experienced. He 
did not, however, mean thereby that his former disorders were 
troubling him, but that he was suffering from a severe attack 
of influenza which he had caught in Santa Margherita, and 
which tormented him for several weeks after his arrival in 
Genoa. As a matter of fact, however, what he complained of 
most was his spiritual condition that indescribable forsaken 
ness to which he gives such heartrending expression in 
"Zarathustra." Even the reception which the first part met 
with at the hands of friends and acquaintances was extremely 
disheartening: for almost all those to whom he presented 
copies of the work misunderstood it. "I found no one ripe for 
many of my thoughts; the case of Zarathustra proves that one 
can speak with the utmost clearness, and yet not be heard by 
any one." My brother was very much discouraged by the feeble 
ness of the response he was given, and as he was striving just 
then to give up the practice of taking hydrate of chloral a 
drug he had begun to take while ill with influenza the fol 
lowing spring, spent in Rome, was a somewhat gloomy one 
for him. He writes about it as follows: "I spent a melancholy 
spring in Rome, where I only just managed to live and this 
was no easy matter. This city, which is absolutely unsuited tq 



XVlli INTRODUCTION 

the poet-author of Zarathustra, and for the choice of which I 
was not responsible, made me inordinately miserable. I tried to 
leave it. I wanted to go to Aquila the opposite of Rome in 
every respect, and actually founded in a spirit of enmity to 
wards that city (just as I also shall found a city some day) , as 
a memento of an atheist and genuine enemy of the Church a 
person very closely related to me the great Hohenstaufen, 
the Emperor Frederick II. But Fate lay behind it all: I had to 
return again to Rome. In the end I was obliged to be satisfied 
with the Piazza Barberini, after I had exerted myself in vain to 
find an anti-Christian quarter. I fear that on one occasion, to 
avoid bad smells as much as possible, I actually inquired at the 
Palazzo del Quirinale whether they could not provide a quiet 
room for a philosopher. In a chamber high above the Piazza 
just mentioned, from which one obtained a general view of 
Rome and could hear the fountains plashing far below, the 
loneliest of all songs was composed The Night-Song. About 
this time I was obsessed by an unspeakably sad melody, the 
refrain of which I recognised in the words, dead through im 
mortality. 

We remained somewhat too long in Rome that spring, and 
what with the effect of the increasing heat and the discour 
aging circumstances already described, my brother resolved not 
to write any more, or in any case, not to proceed with "Zara 
thustra," although I offered to relieve him of all trouble in 
connection with the proofs and the publisher. When, how 
ever, we returned to Switzerland towards the end of June, and 
he found himself once more in the familiar and exhilarating 
air of the mountains, all his joyous creative powers revived, and 
in a note to me announcing the dispatch of some manuscript, 
he wrote as follows: "I have engaged a place heie for three 
months : forsooth, I am the greatest fool to allow my courage to 



INTRODUCTION XIX 

be sapped from me by the climate of Italy. Now and again I 
am troubled by the thought: what next? My future is the 
darkest thing in the world to me, but as there still remains a 
great deal for me to do, I suppose I ought rather to think of 
doing this than of my future, and leave the rest to thee and 
the gods." 

The second part of "Zarathustra" was written between the 
26th of June and the 6th July. "This summer, finding myself 
once more in the sacred place where the first thought of 
Zarathustra flashed across my mind, I conceived the second 
part. Ten days sufficed. Neither for the second, the first, nor 
the third part, have I required a day longer." 

He often used to speak of the ecstatic mood in which he 
wrote "Zarathustra"; how in his walks over hill and dale the 
ideas would crowd into his mind, and how he would note 
them down hastily in a notebook from which he would tran 
scribe them on his return, sometimes working till midnight. He 
says in a letter to me: "You can have no idea of the vehemence 
of such composition," and in "Ecce Homo" (autumn 1888) he 
describes as follows with passionate enthusiasm the incom 
parable mood in which he created Zarathustra: 

Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any 
distinct notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by 
the word inspiration? If not, I will describe it. If one had the 
smallest vestige of superstition in one, it would hardly be 
possible to set aside completely the idea that one is the mere 
incarnation, mouthpiece or medium of an almighty power. The 
idea of revelation in the sense that something becomes sud 
denly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and 
accuracy, which profoundly convulses and upsets one de 
scribes simply the matter of fact. One hears one does not 
seek; one takes one does not ask who gives: a thought sud- 



XX INTRODUCTION 

denly flashes up like lightning, it comes with necessity, un 
hesitatingly I have never had any choice in the matter. There 
is an ecstasy such that the immense strain of it is sometimes 
relaxed by a flood of tears, along with which one s steps either 
rush or involuntarily lag, alternately. There is the feeling that 
one is completely out of hand, with the very distinct conscious 
ness of an endless number of fine thrills and quiverings to the 
very toes; there is a depth of happiness in which the pain- 
fullest and gloomiest do not operate as antitheses, but as con 
ditioned, as demanded in the sense of necessary shades of 
colour in such an overflow of light. There is an instinct for 
rhythmic relations which embraces wide areas of forms 
(length, the need of a wide-embracing rhythm, is almost the 
measure of the force of an inspiration, a sort of counterpart 
to its pressure and tension) . Everything happens quite involun 
tarily, as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom, of absolute 
ness, of power and divinity. The involuntariness of the figures 
and similes is the most remarkable thing; one loses all percep 
tion of what constitutes the figure and what constitutes the 
simile; everything seems to present itself as the readiest, the 
correctest and the simplest means of expression. It actually 
seems, to use one of Zarathustra s own phrases, as if all things 
came unto one, and would fain be similes: Here do all things 
come caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee, for they want to 
ride upon thy back. On every simile dost thou here ride to 
every truth. Here fly open unto thee all being s words and 
word-cabinets; here all being wanteth to become words, here 
all becoming wanteth to learn of thee how to talk. This is my 
experience of inspiration. I do not doubt but that one would 
have to go back thousands of years in order to find some one 
who could say to me: It is mine also! " 

In the autumn of 1883 my brother left the Engadine for 



INTRODUCTION XXI 

Germany and stayed there a few weeks. In the following 
winter, after wandering somewhat erratically through Stresa, 
Genoa, and Spezia, he landed in Nice, where the climate so 
happily promoted his creative powers that he wrote the third 
part of "Zarathustra." "In the winter, beneath the halcyon 
sky of Nice, which then looked down upon me for the first 
time in my life, I found the third Zarathustra and came to 
the end of my task; the whole having occupied me scarcely a 
year. Many hidden corners and heights in the landscapes round 
about Nice are hallowed to me by unforgettable moments. That 
decisive chapter entitled Old and New Tables was composed 
in the very difficult ascent from the station to Eza that won 
derful Moorish village in the rocks. My most creative moments 
were always accompanied by unusual muscular activity. The 
body is inspired: let us waive the question of the soul. I 
might often have been seen dancing in those days. Without a 
suggestion of fatigue I could then walk for seven or eight 
hours on end among the hills. I slept well and laughed well 
I was perfectly robust and patient." 

As we have seen, each of the three parts of "Zarathustra" 
was written, after a more or less short period of preparation 
in about ten days. The composition of the fourth part alone 
was broken by occasional interruptions. The first notes relating 
to this part were written while he and I were staying together 
in Zurich in September 1884. In the following November, 
while staying at Mentone, he began to elaborate these notes, 
and after a long pause, finished the manuscript at Nice be 
tween the end of January and the middle of February 1885. M) 
brother then called this part the fourth and last; but even be 
fore, and shortly after it had been privately printed, he wrote 
to me saying that he still intended writing a fifth and sixth part, 
and notes relating to these parts are now in my possession. This 



XX11 INTRODUCTION 

fourth part (the original MS. of which contains this note: 
"Only for my friends, not for the public") is written in a 
paiticularly personal spirit, and those few to whom he pre 
sented a copy of it, he pledged to the strictest secrecy concern 
ing its contents. He often thought of making this fourth part 
public also, but doubted whether he would ever be able to do 
so without considerably altering certain portions of it. At all 
events he resolved to distribute this manuscript production, of 
which only forty copies were printed, only among those who 
had proved themselves worthy of it, and it speaks eloquently 
of his utter loneliness and need of sympathy in those days, that 
he had occasion to present only seven copies of his book accord 
ing to this resolution. 

Already at the beginning of this history I hinted at the rea 
sons which led my brother to select a Persian as the incarnation 
of his ideal of the majestic philosopher. His reasons, however, 
for choosing Zarathustra of all others to be his mouthpiece, he 
gives us in the following words: "People have never asked 
me, as they should have done, what the name Zarathustra 
precisely means in my mouth, in the mouth of the first Im- 
moralist; for what distinguishes that philosopher from all 
others in the past is the very fact that he was exactly the reverse 
of an immoralist. Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle 
between good and evil the essential wheel in the working of 
things. The translation of morality into the metaphysical, as 
force, cause, end in itself, was bis work. But the very question 
suggests its own answer. Zarathustra created the most porten 
tous error, morality, consequently he should also be the first to 
perceive that error, not only because he has had longer and 
greater experience of the subject than any other thinker all 
history is the experimental refutation of the theory of the so- 
called moral order of things: the more important point is 



INTRODUCTION XXlli 

that Zarathustra was more truthful than any other thinker. In 
his teaching alone do we meet with truthfulness upheld as the 
highest virtue i.e.: the reverse of the cowardice of the ideal 
ist who flees from reality. Zarathustra had more courage in his 
body than any other thinker before or after him. To tell the / 
truth and to aim straight: that is the first Persian virtue. Am I ^ 
understood? . . . The overcoming of morality through itself 
through truthfulness, the overcoming of the moralist 
through his opposite through me : that is what the name *&gt; 
Zarathustra means in my mouth."

YHUS SPAKE 7ARATHUSTRA 



^arathustra s Prologue 



WHEN Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and 
the lake of his home, and went into the mountains. There he 
enjoyed his spirit and his solitude, and for ten years did not 
weary of it. But at last his heart changed, and rising one 
morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the sun, and 
spake thus unto it: 

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst 
not those for whom thou shinest! 

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou 
wouldsthave wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not 
been for me, mine eagle, and my serpent. 

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine 
overflow, and blessed thee for it. 

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gath 
ered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it. 

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once 
more become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their 
riches. 

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in 
the evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light 
also to the nether- world, thou exuberant star! 

Like thee must I go down, as men say, to whom I shall 
descend. 



4 ZARATHUSTRAS PROLOGUE 

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the 
greatest happiness without envy! 

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may 
flow golden out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of: 
thy bliss! 

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra 
is again going to be a man. 

Thus began Zarathustra s down-going. 



Zarathustra went down the mountain alone, no one meeting 
him. When he entered the forest, however, there suddenly 
stood before him an old man, who had left his holy cot to seek 
roots. And thus spake the old man to Zarathustra: 

"No stranger to me is this wanderer: many years ago passed 
he by. Zarathustra he was called; but he hath altered. 

Then thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains: wilt 
thou now carry thy fire into the valleys? Fearest thou not the 
incendiary s doom? 

Yea, I recognize Zarathustra. Pure is his eye, and no loath 
ing lurketh about his mouth. Goeth he not along like a 
dancer? 

Altered is Zarathustra; a child hath Zarathustra become; an 
awakened one is Zarathustra: what wilt thou do in the land of 
the sleepers? 

As in the sea hast thou lived in solitude, and it hath borne 
thee up. Alas, wilt thou now go ashore? Alas, wilt thou again 
drag thy body thyself?" 

Zarathustra answered: "I love mankind." 



ZARATHUSTRAS PROLOGUE 5 

"Why," said the saint, "did I go into the forest and the 
desert? Was it not because I loved men far too well? 

Now I love God: men, I do not love. Man is a thing too 
imperfect for me. Love to man would be fatal to me." 

Zarathustra answered: "What spake I of love! I am bring 
ing gifts unto men." 

"Give them nothing," said the saint. "Take rather part of 
their load, and carry it along with them that will be most 
agreeable unto them: if only it be agreeable unto thee! 

If, however, thou wilt give unto them, give them no more 
than an alms, and let them also beg for it!" 

"No," replied Zarathustra, "I give no alms. I am not poor 
enough for that." 

The saint laughed at Zarathustra, and spake thus: "Then 
see to it that they accept thy treasures! They are distrustful of 
anchorites, and do not believe that we come with gifts. 

The fall of our footsteps ringeth too hollow through their 
streets. And just as at night, when they are in bed and hear a 
man abroad long before sunrise, so they ask themselves con 
cerning us: Where goeth the thief? 

Go not to men, but stay in the forest! Go rather to the ani 
mals! Why not be like me a bear amongst bears, a bird 
amongst birds?" 

"And what doeth the saint in the forest?" asked Zarathustra. 

The saint answered: "I make hymns and sing them; and in 
making hymns I laugh and weep and mumble: thus do I praise 
God. 

With singing, weeping, laughing, and mumbling do I praise 
the God who is my God. But what dost thou bring us as a gift?" 

When Zarathustra had heard these words, he bowed to the 
saint and said: "What should I have to give thee! Let me rather 
hurry hence lest I take aught away from thee!" And thus 



6 ZAJATHUSTRAS PROLOGUE 

they parted from one another, the old man and Zarathustra, 
laughing like schoolboys. 

When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: 
"Could it be possible! This old saint in the forest hath not yet 
heard of it, that God is dead!" 



When Zarathustra arrived at the nearest town which ad 
joineth the forest, he found many people assembled in the 
market-place; for it had been announced that a rope-dancer 
would give a performance. And Zarathustra spake thus unto 
the people: 

/ teach you the Superman. Man is something that is to be 
surpassed. What have ye done to surpass man? 

All beings hitherto have created something beyond them 
selves : and ye want to be the ebb of that great tide, and would 
rather go back to the beast than surpass man? 

What is the ape to man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. 
And just the same shall man be to the Superman: a laughing 
stock, a thing of shame. 

Ye have made your way from the worm to man, and much 
within you is still worm. Once were ye apes, and even yet man 
is more of an ape than any of the apes. 

Even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid 
of plant and phantom. But do I bid you become phantoms or 
plants? 

Lo, i reach you the Superman! 

The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will 
say: The Superman shall be the meaning of the earth! 

I conjure you, my brethren, remain true to the earth, and be- 



ZARATHUSTRAS PROLLV&UM ) 

lieve not those who speak unto you of superearthly hopes! 
Poisoners are they, whether they know it or not. 

Despisers of life are they, decaying ones and poisoned ones 
themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so away with them! 

Once blasphemy against God was the greatest blasphemy; 
but God died, and therewith also those blasphemers. To blas 
pheme the earth is now the dreadf ulest sin, and to rate the heart 
of the unknowable higher than the meaning of the earth! 

Once the soul looked contemptuously on the body, and then 
that contempt was the supreme thing: the soul wished the 
body meagre, ghastly, and famished. Thus it (:hought to escape 
from the body and the earth. 

Oh, that soul was itself meagre, ghastly, and famished; and 
cruelty was the delight of that soul! 

But ye, also, my brethren, tell me: What doth your body say 
about your soul? Is your soul not poverty arid pollution and 
wretched self-complacency? 

Verily, a polluted stream is man. One must be a sea, to re 
ceive a polluted stream without becoming impure. 

Lo, I teach you the Superman: he is that sea; in him can your 
great contempt be submerged. 

What is the greatest thing ye can experience? It is the hour 
of great contempt. The hour in which even your happiness be- 
cometh loathsome unto you, and so also your reason and virtue. 

The hour when ye say: "What good is my happiness! It is 
poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency. But my 
happiness should justify existence itself!" 

The hour when ye say: "What good is my reason! Doth it 
long for knowledge as the lion for his food? It is poverty and 
pollution ano wretched self-complacency!" 

The hour when ye say: "What good is my virtue! As yet it 
hath no* 1 made me passionate. How weary I am of my good 



8 ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 

and my bad! It is all poverty and pollution and wretched self- 
complacency!" 

The hour when ye say: "What good is my justice! I do not 
see that I am fervour and fuel. The just, however, are fervour 
and fuel!" 

The hour when we say: "What good is my pity! Is not pity 
the cross on which he is nailed who loveth man? But my pity 
is not a crucifixion." 

Have ye ever spoken thus? Have ye ever cried thus? Ah! 
would that I had heard you crying thus! 

It is not your sin it is your self-satisfaction that crieth unto 
heaven; your very sparingness in sin crieth unto heaven! 

Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue? Where 
is the frenzy with which ye should be inoculated? 

Lo, I teach you the Superman: he is that lightning, he is that 
frenzy! 

When Zarathustra had thus spoken, one of the people called 
out: "We have now heard enough of the rope-dancer; it is 
time now for us to see him!" And all the people laughed at 
Zarathustra. But the rope-dancer, who thought the words ap 
plied to mm. began his performance. 



Zarathustra, however, looked at the people and wondered. 
Then he spake thus: 

Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Super 
man a rope over an abyss. 

A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous 
looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting. 

What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal; 



ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 9 

what is lovable in man is that he is an over- going and a down- 
going. 

I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, 
for they are the over-goers. 

I love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, 
and arrows of longing for the other shore. 

I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars 
for going down and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to 
the earth, that the earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive. 

I love him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know 
in order that the Superman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he 
his own down-going. 

I love him who laboureth and inventeth, that he may build 
the house for the Superman, and prepare for him earth, animal, 
and plant: for thus seeketh he his own down-going. 

I love him who loveth his virtue: for virtue is the will to 
down-going, and an arrow of longing. 

I love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself, but 
wanteth to be wholly the spirit of his virtue: thus walketh he 
as spirit over the bridge. 

I love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and destiny: 
thus, for the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live 
no more. 

I love him who desireth not too many virtues. One virtue is 
more of a virtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one s 
destiny to cling to. 

I love him whose soul is lavish, who wanteth no thanks ana 
doth not give back: for he always bestoweth, and desireth not 
to keep for himself. 

1 love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favour, 
and who then asketh: "Am I a dishonest player?" for he is 
willing to succumb. 



io ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 

I love him who scattereth golden words in advance of his 
deeds, and always doeth more than he promiseth: for he 
seeketh his own down-going. 

I love him who justified! the future ones, and redeemeth 
the past ones : for he is willing to succumb through the present 
ones. 

I love him who chasteneth his God, because he loveth his 
God: for he must succumb through the wrath of his God. 

I love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and 
may succumb through a small matter: thus goeth he willingly 
over the bridge. 

I love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgetteth him 
self, and all things are in him : thus all things become his down- 
going. 

I love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart: thus is his 
head only ths bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causeth 
his down-going. 

I love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of 
the dark cloud that lowereth over man : they herald the coming 
of the lightning, and succumb as heralds. 

Lo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of 
the cloud: the lightning, however, is the Superman. 



When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he again looked 
at the people, and was silent. "There they stand," said he to his 
heart; "there they laugh: they understand me not; I am not the 
mouth for these ears. 

Must one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear 
with their eyes? Must one clatter like kettledrums arid peni- 



iARATHUSTRA s PROLOGUE H 

tential preachers? Or do they only believe the stamiuerer? 

They have something whereof they are proud. What do they 
call it, that which maketh them proud? Culture, they call it; il 
distinguished! them from the goatherds. 

They dislike, therefore, to hear of contempt of themselves, 
So I will appeal to their pride. 

I will speak unto them of tlie most contemptible thing! 
that, however, is the last man!" 

And thus spake Zarathustra unto the people: 

It is time for man to fix his goal. It is time for man to plant 
the germ of his highest hope. 

Still is his soil rich enough for it. But that soil will one day 
be poor and exhausted, and no lofty tree will any longer be 
able to grow thereon. 

Alas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch 
the arrow of his longing beyond man and the string of his 
bow will have unlearned to whizz! 

I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to 
a dancing star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you. 

Alas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give 
birth to any star. Alas! There cometh the time of the most 
despicable man, who can no longer despise himself. 

Lo! I show you the last man. 

"What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is 
a star?" so asketh the last man and blinketh. 

The earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth 
the last man who maketh everything small. His species is in 
eradicable like that of the ground-flea; the last man liveth 
longest. 

"We liave discovered happiness" say the last men, and 
blink thereby. 

They have left the regions where it is hard to live; for thef 



12 ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 

need warmth. One still loveth one s neighbour and rubbeth 
against him; for one needeth warmth. 

Turning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they 
walk warily. He is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or 
men! 

A little poison now and then: that maketh pleasant dreams. 
And much poison at last for a pleasant death. 

One still worketh, for work is a pastime. But one is careful 
lest the pastime should hurt one. 

One no longer becometh poor or rich; both are too burden 
some. Who still wanteth to rule? Who stili wanteth to obey? 
Both are too burdensome. 

No shepherd, and one herd! Everyone wanteth the same; 
everyone is equal : he who hath other sentiments goeth volun 
tarily into the madhouse. 

"Formerly all the world was insane," say the subtlest of 
them, and blink thereby. 

They are clever and know all that hath happened: so there 
is no end to their raillery. People still fall out, but are soon 
reconciled otherwise it spoileth their stomachs. 

They have their little pleasures for the day, and their little 
pleasures for the night, but they have a regard for health. 

"We have discovered happiness," say the last men, and 
blink thereby. 

And here ended the first discourse of Zarathustra, which is 
also called "The Prologue", for at this point the shouting and 
mirth of the multitude interrupted him. "Give us this last man, 
O Zarathustra," they called out "make us into these last 
men! Then will we make thee a present of the Superman!" 
And all the people exulted and smacked their lips. Zarathustra, 
however, turned sad, and said to his heart : 

They understand me not: I am not the mouth for these ears. 



ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 13 

Toe long, perhaps, have I lived in the mountains; too much 
have I hearkened unto the brooks and trees: now do I speak 
unto them as unto the goatherds. 

Calm is my soul, and clear, like the mountains in the morn 
ing. But they think me cold, and a mocker with terrible jests. 

And now do they look at me and laugh: and while they 
laugh they hate me too. There is ice in their laughter." 



6 



Then, however, something happened which made every 
mouth mute and every eye fixed. In the meantime, of course, 
the rope-dancer had commenced his performance: he had come 
out at a little door, and was going along the rope which was 
stretched between two towers, so that it hung above the market 
place and the people. When he was just midway across, the 
little door opened once more, and a gaudily-dressed fellow like 
a buffoon sprang out, and went rapidly after the first one. "Go 
on, halt-foot," cried his frightful voice, "go on, lazy-bones, 
interloper, sallow- face! lest I tickle thee with my heel! What 
dost thou here between the towers? In the tower is the place 
for thee, thou shouldst be locked up; to one better than thyself 
thou blockest the way!" And with every word he came nearer 
and nearer the first one. When, however, he was but a step 
behind, there happened the frightful thing which made every 
mouth mute and every eye fixed he uttered a yell like a devil, 
and jumped over the other who was in his way. The latter, 
however, when he thus saw his rival triumph, lost at the same 
time his head and his footing on the rope; he threw his pole 
away, and shot downward faster than it, like an eddy of arms 
and legs, into the depth. The market-place and the people were 



14 ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 

like the sea when the storm cometh on: they all flew apart and 
in disorder, especially where the body was about to fall. 

Zarathustra, however, remained standing, and just beside 
him fell the body, badly injured and disfigured, but not yet 
dead. After a while consciousness returned to the shattered 
man, and he saw Zarathustra kneeling beside him. "What art 
thou doing there?" said he at last, "I knew long ago that the 
devil would trip me up. Now he draggeth me to hell: wilt thou 
prevent him?" 

"On mine honour, my friend," answered Zarathustra, 
"there is nothing of all that whereof thou speakest: there is no 
devil and no hell. Thy soul will be dead even sooner than thy 
body; fear, therefore, nothing any more!" 

The man looked up distrustfully. "If thou speakest the 
truth," said he, "I lose nothing when I lose my life. J am not 
much more than an animal which hath been taught to dance by 
blows and scanty fare." 

"Not at all," said Zarathustra, "thou hast made danger thy 
calling; therein there is nothing contemptible. Now thou 
perishest by thy calling: therefore will I bury thee with mine 
own hands." 

When Zarathustra had said this the dying one did not reply 
further; but he moved his hand as if he sought the hand of 
Zarathustra in gratitude. 



Meanwhile the evening came on, and the market-place 
veiled itself in gloom. Then the people dispersed, for even 
curiosity and terror become fatigued. Zarathustra, however, 
rtill sat beside the dead man on the ground, absorbed in 



ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 15 

thought: so he forgot the time. But at last it became night, and 
a cold wind blew upon the lonely one. Then arose Zarathustra 
and said to his heart: 

Verily, a fine catch of fish hath Zarathustra made to-day! It is 
not a man he hath caught, but a corpse. 

Sombre is human life, and as yet without meaning: a buffoon 
may be fateful to it. 

I want to teach men the sense of their existence, which is the 
Superman, the lightning out of the dark cloud man. 

But still am I far from them, and my sense speaketh not unto 
their sense. To men I am still something between a fool and 
a corpse. 

Gloomy is the night, gloomy are the ways of Zarathustra. 
Come, thou cold and stiff companion! I carry thee to the place 
where I shall bury thee with mine own hands. 



8 



When Zarathustra had said this to his heart, he put the 
corpse upon his shoulders and set out on his way. Yet had he 
not gone a hundred steps, when there stole a man up to him 
and whispered in his ear and lo! he that spake was the buf 
foon from the tower. "Leave this town, O Zarathustra," said 
he, "there are too many here who hate thee. The good and just 
hate thee, and call thee their enemy and despiser; the believers 
in the orthodox belief hate thee, and call thee a danger to the 
multitude. It was thy good fortune to be laughed at: and verily 
thou spakest like a buffoon. It was thy good fortune to associate 
with the dead dog; by so humiliating thyself thou hast saved 
thy life today. Depart, however, from this town, or tomor 
row I shall jump over thee, a living man over a dead one." And 



16 ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 

when he had said this, the buffoon vanished; Zarathustra, how 
ever, went on through the dark streets. 

At the gate of the town the grave-diggers met him: they 
shone their torch on his face, and, recognising Zarathustra. 
they sorely derided him. "Zarathustra is carrying away the dead 
dog: a fine thing tnat Zarathustra hath turned a- grave-digger! 
For our hands are too cleanly for that roast. Will Zarathustra 
steal the bite from the devil? Well then, good luck to the re 
past! If only the devil is not a better thief than Zarathustra! 
he will steal them both, he will eat them both!" And they 
laughed among themselves, and put their heads together. 

Zarathustra made no answer thereto, but went on his way. 
When he had gone on for two hours, past forests and swamps, 
he had heard too much of the hungry howling of the wolves, 
and he himself became hungry. So he halted at a lonely house 
in which a light was burning. 

"Hunger attacketh me," said Zarathustra, "like a robber. 
Among forests and swamps my hunger attacketh me, and late 
in the night. 

"Strange humours hath my hunger. Often it cometh to me 
only after a repast, and all day it hath failed to come: where 
hath it been?" 

And thereupon Zarathustra knocked at the door of the 
house. An old man appeared, who carried a light, and asked : 
"Who cometh unto me and my bad sleep?" 

"A living man and a dead one," said Zarathustra. "Give me 
something to eat and drink, I forgot it during the day. He that 
feedeth the hungry refresheth his own soul, saith wisdom." 

The old man withdrew, but came back immediately and 
offered Zarathustra bread and wine. "A bad country for the 
hungry," said he; "that is why I live here. Animal and man 
come unto me, the anchorite. But bid thy companion eat arxi 



ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGCJE 17 

drink also, he is wearier than thou." Zarathustra answered: 
"My companion is dead; I shall hardly be able to persuade him 
to eat." "That doth not concern me," said the old man sullenly; 
"he that knocketh at my door must take what I offer him. Eat, 
and fare ye well!" 

Thereafter Zarathustra again went on for two hours, trust 
ing to the path and the light of the stars: for he was an experi 
enced night-walker, and liked to look into the face of all thai 
slept. When the morning dawned, however, Zarathustra found 
himself in a thick forest, and no path was any longer visible. 
He then put the dead man in a hollow tree at his head for he 
wanted to protect him from the wolves and laid himself 
down on the ground and moss. And immediately he fell asleep, 
tired in body, but with a tranquil soul. 



Long slept Zarathustra; and not only the rosy dawn passed 
over his head, but also the morning. At last, however, his eyes 
opened, and amazedly he gazed into the forest and the stillness, 
amazedly he gazed into himself. Then he arose quickly, like a 
seafarer who all at once seeth the land; and he shouted for joy: 
for he saw a new truth. And he spake thus to his heart: 

A light hath dawned upon me: I need companions living 
ones; not dead companions and corpses, which I carry with me 
where I will. 

But I need living companions, who will follow me because 
they want to follow themselves and to the place where I will. 
A light hath dawned upon me. Not to the people is Zarathustra 
to speak, but to companions! Zarathustra shall not be the herd s 
herdsman and hound! 



i8 ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 

To allure many from the herd for that purpose have I 
come. The people and the herd must be angry with me: a rob 
ber shall Zarathustra be called by the herdsmen. 

Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the good and just. 
Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the believers in the 
orthodox belief. 

Behold the good and just! Whom do they hate most? Him 
who breaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the law 
breaker: he, however, is the creator. 

Behold the believers of all beliefs! Whom do they hate 
most? Him who breaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, 
the law-breaker he, however, is the creator. 

Companions, the creator seeketh, not corpses and not 
herds or believers either. Fellow-creators the creator seeketh 
those who grave new values on new tables. 

Companions, the creator seeketh, and f ellow- reapers : for 
everything is ripe for the harvest with him. But he lacketh the 
hundred sickles: so he plucketh the ears of corn and is vexed. 

Companions, the creator seeketh, and such as know how to 
whet their sickles. Destroyers, will they be called, and despisers 
of good and evil. But they are the reapers and rejoicers. 

Fellow-creators, Zarathustra seeketh; fellow-reapers and 
fellow- rejoicers, Zarathustra seeketh: what hath he to do with 
herds and herdsmen and corpses! 

And thou, my first companion, rest in peace! Well have I 
buried thee in thy hollow tree; well have I hid thee from the 
wolves. 

But I part from thee; the time hath arrived. Twixt rosy 
dawn and rosy dawn there came unto me a new truth. 

I am not to be a herdsman, I am not to be a grave-digger. 
Not any more will I discourse unto the people; for the last time 
have I spoken unto the dead. 



ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 19 

With the creators, the reapers, and the rejoicers will I asso 
ciate : the rainbow will I show them, and all the stairs to the 
Superman. 

To the lone-dwellers will I sing my song, and to the twain- 
dwellers; and unto him who hath still ears for the unheard, 
will I make the heart heavy with my happiness. 

I make for my goal, I follow my course; over the loitering 
and tardy will I leap. Thus let my on-going be their down- 
going! 



10 



This had Zarathustra said to his heart when the sun stood at 
noon-tide. Then he looked inquiringly aloft, for he heard 
above him the sharp call of a bird. And behold! An eagle swept 
through the air in wide circles, and on it hung a serpent, not 
like a prey, but like a friend : for it kept itself coiled round the 
eagle s neck. 

"They are mine animals," said Zarathustra, and rejoiced in 
his heart. 

"The proudest animal under the sun, and the wisest animal 
under the sun. they have come out to reconnoitre. 

They want to know whether Zarathustra still liveth. Verily, 
do I still live? 

More dangerous have I found it among men than among 
animals; in dangerous paths goeth Zarathustra. Let mine ani 
mals lead me!" 

When Zarathustra had said this, he remembered the words 
of the saint in the forest. Then he sighed and spake thus to 
his heart: 

"Would that I were wiser! Would that I were wise from ttM 
very heart, like my serpent! 



4&gt;0 ZARATHUSTRAS PROLOGUE 

But I am asking the impossible. Therefore do I ask my pride 
to go always with my wisdom! 

And if my wisdom should some day forsake me: alas! it 
loveth to fly away! may my pride then fly with my folly!" 

Thus began Zarathustra s down-going.

/. The Three Metamoi phases 



THREE metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: now 
the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at 
last a child. 

Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load- 
bearing spirit in which reverence dwelleth : for the heavy and 
the heaviest longeth its strength. 

What is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then 
kneeleth it down like the camel, and wanteth to be well laden. 

What is the heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bear 
ing spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength. 

Is it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one s 
pride? To exhibit one s folly in order to mock at one s wisdom? 

Or is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its 
triumph? To ascend high mountains to tempt the tempter? 

Or is it this : To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, 
and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul? 

Or is it this : To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make 
friends of the deaf, who never hear thy requests? 

Or is it this : To go into foul water when it is the water of 
truth, and not disclaim cold frogs and hot toads? 

Or is it this: To love those who despise us, and give one s 
hand to the phantom when it is going to frighten us? 

All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon 
itself: and like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into 
the wilderness, so hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness. 

23 



24 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

But in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second meta 
morphosis: here the spirit becometh a lion; freedom will it 
capture, and lordship in its own wilderness. 

Its last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to 
its last God; for victory will it struggle with the great dragon. 

What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer in 
clined to call Lord and God? "Thou-shalt," is the great dragon 
called. But the spirit of the lion saith, "I will." 

"Thou-shalt," lieth in its path, sparkling with gold a scale- 
covered beast; and on every scale glittereth golden, "Thou 
shalt!" 

The values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and 
thus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: "All the values of 
things glitter on me. 

All values have already been created, and all created values 
do I represent. Verily, there shall be no I will any more." 
Thus speaketh the dragon. 

My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the 
spirit? Why sufnceth not the beast of burden, which re- 
nounceth and is reverent? 

To create new values that, even the lion cannot yet accom 
plish : but to create itself freedom for new creating that can 
the might of the lion do. 

To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto 
duty: for that, my brethren, there is need of the lion. 

To assume the ride to new values that is the most formi 
dable assumption for a load-bearing and reverent spirit. Verily, 
unto such a spirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey. 

As its holiest, it once loved "Thou-shalt": now is it forced 
to find illusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest things, that 
it may capture freedom from its love: the lion is needed for 
Hhiis cant^re, 



THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE 2% 

But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which eveo 
the lion could not do? Why hath the preying lion still to be 
c.ome a child? 

Innocence is the child, and f orgetf ulness, a new beginning, 
a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea. 

Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed 
i holy Yea unto life: its own will, willeth now the spirit; his 
own world winneth the world s outcast. 

Three metamorphoses of the spirit have I designated to you: 
how the spirit became a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion 
at last a child. 

Thus spake Zarathustra. And at that time he abode in the 
town which is called The Pied Cow. 



2. The Academic Chairs of Virtue 



PEOPLE commended unto Zarathustra a wise man, as one who 
could discourse well about sleep and virtue: greatly was he 
honoured and rewarded for it, and all the youths sat before 
his chair. To him went Zarathustra, and sat among the youths 
before his chair. And thus spake the wise man: 

Respect and modesty in presence of sleep! That is the first 
thing! And to go out of the way of all who sleep badly and 
keep awake at night! 

Modest is even the thief in presence of sleep: he always 
steal eth softly through the night. Immodest, however, is the 
night-watchman; immodestly he carrieth his horn. 



26 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

No small art is it to sleep: it is necessary for that purpose 
to keep awake all day. 

Ten times a day must thou overcome thyself: that causeth 
wholesome weariness, and is poppy to the soul. 

Ten times must thou reconcile again with thyself; for over 
coming is bitterness, and badly sleep the unreconciled. 

Ten truths must thou find during the day; otherwise wilt 
thou seek truth during the night, and thy soul will have been 
hungry. 

Ten times must thou laugh during the day, and be cheerful; 
otherwise thy stomach, the father of affliction, will disturb 
thee in the night. 

Few people know it, but one must have all the virtues in 
order to sleep well. Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit 
adultery? 

Shall I covet my neighbour s maidservant? All that would ill 
accord with good sleep. 

And even if one have all the virtues, there is still one thing 
needful: to send the virtues themselves to sleep at the right 
time. 

That they may not quarrel with one another, the good 
females! And about thee, thou unhappy one! 

Peace with God and thy neighbour: so desireth good sleep. 
And peace also with thy neighbour s devil! Otherwise it will 
haunt thee in the night. 

Honour to the government, and obedience, and 1 also to the 
crooked government! So desireth good sleep. How can 1 help 
it, if power liketh to walk on crooked legs? 

He who leadeth his sheep to the greenest pasture, shall 
always be for ine the best shepherd: so doth it accord with 
good sleep. 



THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE 2J 

Many honours I want not, nor great treasures: they excite 
the spleen. But it is bad sleeping without a good name and a 
little treasure. 

A small company is more welcome to me than a bad one: but 
they must come and go at the right time. So doth it accord 
with good sleep. 

Well, also, do the poor in spirit please me: they promote 
sleep. Blessed are they, especially if one always give in to them. 

Thus passeth the day unto the virtuous. When night cometh, 
then take I good care not to summon sleep. It disliketh to be 
summoned sleep, the lord of the virtues! 

But I think of what I have done and thought during the day. 
Thus ruminating, patient as a cow, I ask myself: What were thy 
ten overcomings? 

And what were the ten reconciliations, and the ten truths, 
and the ten laughters with which my heart enjoyed itself? 

Thus pondering, and cradled by forty thoughts, it over- 
taketh me all at once sleep, the unsummoned, the lord of the 
virtues. 

Sleep tappeth on mine eye, and it turneth heavy. Sleep 
toucheth my mouth, and it remaineth open. 

Verily, on soft soles doth it come to me, the dearest of 
thieves, and stealeth from me my thoughts: stupid do I then 
stand, like this academic chair. 

But not much longer do I then stand : I already lie. 

When Zarathustra heard the wise man thus speak, he 
laughed in his heart: for thereby had a light dawned upon him 
And thus spake he to his heart: 

A fool seemeth this wise man with his forty thoughts: but 
I believe he knoweth well how to sleep. 

Happy even is he who liveth near this wise man! Such sleep 
s rontao-ious even th rou r crh_ a thick wall it is contagious. 



28 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

A magic resideth even in his academic chair. And not in vain 
did the youths sit before the preacher of virtue. 

His wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well. And 
verily, if life had no sense, and had I to choose nonsense, this 
would be the desirablest nonsense for me also. 

Now know I well what people sought formerly above all else 
when they sought teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought 
for themselves, and poppy-head virtues to promote it! 

To all those belauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom 
was sleep without dreams: they knew no higher significance 
of life. 

Even at present, to be sure, there are some like this preacher 
of virtue, and not always so honourable: but their time is past. 
And not much longer do they stand : there they already lie. 

Blessed are those drowsy ones: for they shall soon nod to 
sleep. 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



j. Backworldsmen 

ONCE on a time, Zarathustra also cast his fancy beyond man, 
like all backworldsmen. The work of a suffering and tortured 
God, did the world then seem to me. 

The dream and diction of a God, did the world then 
seem to me; coloured vapours before the eyes of a divinely 
dissatisfied one. 

Good and evil, and joy and woe, and I and thou coloured 



BACKWORLDSMEN 29 

vapours did they seem to me before creative eyes. The creator 
wished to look away from himself, thereupon he created the 
world, 

Intoxica^ ng joy is it for the sufferer to look away from his 
suffering and forget himself. Intoxicating joy and self -forget 
ting, did the world once seem to me. 

This world, the eternally imperfect, an eternal contradic 
tion s image and imperfect image an intoxicating joy to its 
imperfect creator: thus did the world once seem to me. 

Thus, once on a time, did I also cast my fancy beyond man, 
like all backworldsmen. Beyond man, forsooth? 

Ah, ye brethren, that God whom I created was human work 
and human madness, like all the gods! 

A man was he, and only a poor fragment of a man and ego. 
Out of mine own ashes and glow it came unto me, that phan 
tom. And verily, it came not unto me from the beyond! 

What happened, my brethren? I surpassed myself, the suf 
fering one; I carried mine own ashes to the mountain; a 
brighter flame I contrived for myself. And lo! Thereupon the 
phantom withdrew from me! 

To me the convalescent would it now be suffering and 
torment to believe in such phantoms : suffering would it now be 
to me, and humiliation. Thus speak I to backworldsmen. 

Suffering was it, and impotence that created all back- 
worlds; and the short madness of happiness, which only the 
greatest sufferer experienced.!. 

Weariness, which seeketh to get to the ultimate with one 
leap, with a death-leap; a poor ignorant weariness, unwilling 
even to will any longer: that created all gods and backworlds. 

Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despairea 
of the body it groped with the Angers or the infatuated spirit 
at the ultimate walls. 



30 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of 
the earth it heard the bowels of existence speaking unto it. 

And then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its 
head and not with its head only into "the other world." 

But that "other world" is well concealed from man, that 
dehumanised, inhuman world, which is a celestial naught; and 
the bowels of existence do not speak unto man, except as man. 

Verily, it is difficult to prove all being, and hard to make it 
speak. Tell me, ye brethren, is not the strangest of all things 
best proved? .- 

Yea, this ego, with its contradiction and perplexity, speaketh 
most uprightly of its being this creating, willing, evaluing 
ego, which is the measure and value of things. 

And this most upright existence, the ego it speaketh of the 
body, and still implieth the body, even when it museth and 
raveth and fluttereth with broken wings. 

Always more uprightly learneth it to speak, the ego; and 
the more it learneth, the more doth it find titles, and honours 
for the body and the earth. 

A new pride taught me mine ego, and that teach I unto 
men: no longer to thrust one s head into the sand of celestial 
things, but to carry it freely, a terrestrial head, which giveth 
meaning to the earth! 

A new will teach I unto men: to choose that path which 
man hath followed blindly, and to approve of it and no 
longer to slink aside from it, like the sick and perishing! 

The sick and perishing it was they who despised the body 
and the earth, and invented the heavenly world, and the re 
deeming blood-drops; but even those sweet and sad poisons 
they borrowed from the body and the earth! 

From their misery they sought escape, and the stars wer* 



BACKWORLDSMEN 3! 

too remote for them. Then they sighed: "O that there were 
heavenly paths by which to steal into another existence and 
into happiness!" Then they contrived for themselves their by- 
paths and bloody draughts! 

Beyond the sphere of their body and this earth they now 
fancied themselves transported, these ungrateful ones. But to 
what did they owe the convulsion and rapture of their trans 
port? To their body and this earth. 

Gentle is Zarathustra to the sickly. Verily, he is not indig 
nant at their modes of consolation and ingratitude. May they 
become convalescents and overcomers, and create higher bodies 
for themselves! 

Neither is Zarathustra indignant at a convalescent who 
looketh tenderly on his delusions, and at midnight stealeth 
round the grave of his God; but sickness and a sick frame re 
main even in his tears. 

Many sickly ones have there always been among those who 
muse, and languish for God; violently they hate the discern 
ing ones, and the latest of virtues, which is uprightness. 

Backward they always gaze toward dark ages: then, indeed, 
were delusion and faith something different. Raving of the 
reason was likeness to God, and doubt was sin. 

Too well do I know those godlike ones : they insist on being 
believed in, and that doubt is sin. Too well, also, do I know 
what they themselves most believe in. 

Verily, not in backworlds and redeeming blood-drops: but 
in the body do they also believe most; and their own body is 
for them the thing-in-itself . 

But it is a sickly thing to them, and gladly would they get 
out of their skin. Therefore hearken they to the preachers of 
death, and themselves preach backworlds. 



32 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Hearken rather, my brethren, to the voice of the healthy 
body; it is a more upright and pure voice. 

More uprightly and purely speaketh the healthy body, per 
fect and square-built; and it speaketh of the meaning of the 
earth. 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



4. TheDespisersoftheBody 



To THE despisers of the body will I speak my word. 1 wish 
them neither to learn afresh, nor teach anew, but only to bid 
farewell to their own bodies, and thus be dumb. 

"Body am 1, and soul" so saith the child. And why should 
one not speak like children? 

But the awakened one, the knowing one, saith: "Body am I 
entirely, and nothing more; and soul is only the name of some 
thing in the body." 

The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war 
and a peace, a flock and a shepherd. 

An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my 
brother, which thou callest "spirit" a little instrument and 
plaything of thy big sagacity. 

"Ego," sayest thou, and art proud of that word. Bur the 
greater thing in which thou art unwilling to believe is thy 
body with its big sagacity; it saith not "ego," but doeth it. 

What the sense feeleth, what the spirit discerneth, hath 
never its end in itself. But sense and spirit would fain persuade 
thee that tney are the end ot al! things: so vain arc they, 



THE DESP1SERS OF THE BODY 33 

Instruments and playthings are sense and spirit: be hirid 
them there is still the Self. The Self seeketh with the eyes of 
Che senses, it bearkeneth also with the ears of the spirit. 

Ever hearkeneth the Self, and seeketh; it compareth, mas- 
tereth, conquereth, and destroyeth. It ruleth, and is also the 
ego s ruler. 

Behind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a 
mighty lord, an unknown sage it is called Self; it dwelleth in 
thy body, it is thy body. 

There is more sagacity in thy body than in thy best wis 
dom. And who then knoweth why thy body requireth just thy 
best wisdom? 

Thy Self laugheth at thine ego, and its proud prancings. 
"What are these prancings and flights of thought unto me?" 
it saith to itself. "A by-way to my purpose. I am the leading- 
string of the ego, and the prompter of its notions." 

The Self saith unto the ego: "Feel pain!" And thereupon it 
suffereth, and thinketh how it may put an end thereto and for 
that very purpose it is meant to think. 

The Self saith unto the ego: "Feel pleasure!" Thereupon it 
rejoiceth, and thinketh how it may ofttimes rejoice and for 
that very purpose it is meant to think. 

To the despisers of the body will I speak a word. That they 
despise is caused by their esteem. What is it that created 
esteeming and despising and worth and will? 

The creating Self created for itself esteeming and despising, 
it created for itself joy and woe. The creating body created for 
itself spirit, as a hand to its will. 

Even in your folly and despising ye each serve your Self, 
ye despisers of the body. I tell you, your very Self wanteth 
to die, and turneth away from life. 

No longer can your Self do that which it desireth most: 



34 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

create beyond itself. That is what it desireth most; that is all 
its fervour. 

But it is now too late to do so: so your Self wisheth to 
succumb, ye despisers of the body. 

To succumb so wisheth your Self; and therefore have ye 
become despisers of the body. For ye can no longer create be 
yond yourselves. 

And therefore are ye now angry with life and with the earth. 
And unconscious envy is in the sidelong look of your contempt. 

I go not your way, ye despisers of the body! Ye are no 
bridges for me to the Superman! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



MY BROTHER, when thou hast a virtue, and it is thine own 
virtue, thou hast it in common with no one. 

To be sure, thou wouldst call it by name and caress it; thou 
wouldst pull its ears and amuse thyself with it. 

And lo! Then hast thou its name in common with the 
people, and hast become one of the people and the herd with 
thy virtue! 

Better for thee to say: "Ineffable is it, and nameless, that 
which is pain and sweetness to my soul, and also the hunger of 
my bowels." 

Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and 
if thou must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it. 



JOYS AND PASSIONS 35 

Thus speak and stammer: "That is my good, that do I love, 
thus doth it please me entirely, thus only do 1 desire the good. 

Not as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law 
or a human need do I desire it; it is not to be a guide-post for 
me to superearths and paradises, 

An earthly virtue is it which I love: little prudence is 
therein, and the least everyday wisdom. 

But that bird built its nest beside me: therefore, I love and 
cherish it now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs." 

Thus shouldst thou stammer, and praise thy virtue. 

Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But no\fc 
hast thou only thy virtues: they grew out of thy passions. 

Thou implantedst thy highest aim into the heart of those 
passions: then became they thy virtues and joys. 

And though thou wert of the race of the hot- tempered, or 
of the voluptuous, or of the fanatical, or the vindictive; 

All thy passions in the end became virtues, and all thy devils 
angels. 

Once hadst thou wild dogs in thy cellar: but they changed 
at last into birds and charming songstresses. 

Out of thy poisons brewedst thou balsam for thyself; thy 
cow, affliction, milkedst thou now drinketh thou the sweet 
milk of her udder. 

And nothing evil groweth in thee any longer, unless it be 
the evil that groweth out of the conflict of thy virtues. 

My brother, if thou be fortunate, then wilt thou have one 
virtue and no more: thus goest thou easier over the bridge. 

Illustrious is it to have many virtues, but a hard lot; and 
many a one hath gone into the wilderness and killed himself 
because he was weary of being the battle and battlefield ol 
virtues. 



^6 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

My brother, are war and battle evil? Necessary, however, is 
the evil; necessary are the envy and the distrust and the back 
biting among the virtues. 

Lo! how each of thy virtues is covetous of the highest place; 
it wanteth thy whole spirit to be its herald, it wanteth thy whole 
power, in wrath, hatred, and love. 

Jealous is every virtue of the others, and a dreadful thing is 
jealousy. Even virtues may succumb by jealousy. 

He whom the flame of jealousy encompasseth, turneth at 
last, like the scorpion, the poisoned sting against himself. 

Ah! my brother, hast thou never seen a virtue backbite and 
stab itself? 

Man is something that hath to be surpassed : and therefore 
shalt thou love thy virtues, for thou wilt succumb by them. 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



6. The Pale Criminal 



YE DO not mean to slay, ye judges and sacrificers, until the 
animal hath bowed its head? Lo! the pale criminal hath bowed 
his head : out of his eye speaketh the great contempt. 

"Mine ego is something which is to be surpassed: mine ego 
is to me the great contempt of man": so speaketh it out of 
that eye. 

When he judged himself that was his supreme moment; 
let not the exalted one relapse again into his low estate! 

There is no salvation for him who thus suffereth from him 
self, unless it be speedy death. 



THE PALE CRIMINAL 37 

Your slaying, ye judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; 
and in that ye slay, see to it that ye yourselves justify life! 

It is not enough that ye should reconcile with him whom 
ye slay. Let your sorrow be love to the Superman: thus will ye 
justify your own survival! 

"Enemy" shall ye say but not "villain," "invalid" shall ye 
say but not "wretch," "fool" shall ye say but not "sinner." 

And thou, red judge, if thou would say audibly all thou hast 
done in thought, then would every one cry: "Away with the 
nastiness and the virulent reptile!" 

But one thing is the thought, another thing is the deed, ana 
another thing is the idea of the deed. The wheel of causality 
doth not roll between them. 

An idea made this pale man pale. Adequate was he for his 
deed when he did it, but the idea of it, he could not endure 
when it was done, 

Evermore did he now see himself as the doer of one deed. 
Madness, I call this: the exception reversed itself to the rule in 
him. 

The streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen; the stroke he struck 
bewitched his weak reason. Madness after the deed, I call this. 

Hearken, ye judges! There is another madness besides, and 
it is before the deed. Ah! ye have not gone deep enough into 
this soul! 

Thus speaketh the red judge: "Why did this criminal com 
mit murder? He meant to rob." I tell you, however, that his 
soul wanted blood, not booty: he thirsted for the happiness of 
the knife! 

But his weak reason understood not this madness and it 
persuaded him. "What matter about blood!" it said; "wishest 
thou not, at least, to make booty thereby? Or take revenge?" 



38 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

And he hearkened unto his weak reason: like lead lay its 
words upon him thereupon he robbed when he murdered. 
He did not mean to be ashamed of his madness. 

And now once more lieth the lead of his guilt upon him, 
and once more is his weak reason so benumbed, so paralysed, 
and so dull. 

Could he only shake his head, then would his burden roll off; 
but who shaketh that head? 

What is this man? A mass of diseases that reach out into 
the world through the spirit; there they want to get their 
prey. 

What is this man? A coil of wild serpents that are seldom 
at peace among themselves so they go forth apart and seek 
prey in the world. 

Look at that poor body! What it suffered and craved, the 
poor soul interpreted to itself it interpreted it as murderous 
desire, and eagerness for the happiness of the knife. 

Him who now turneth sick, the evil overtaketh which is 
now the evil : he seeketh to cause pain with that which causeth 
him pain. But there have been other ages, and another evil and 
good. 

Once was doubt evil, and the will to Self. Then the invalid 
became a heretic or sorcerer; as heretic or sorcerer he suffered, 
and sought to cause suffering. 

But this will not enter your ears; it hurteth your good 
people, ye tell me. But what doth it matter to me about your 
good people! 

Many things in your good people cause me disgust, and 
verily, not their evil. I would that they had a madness by which 
they succumbed, like this pale criminal! 

Verily, I would that their madness were called truth, or 



READING AND WRITING 39 

fidelity, or justice: but they have their virtue in order to live 
long, and in wretched self-complacency. 

I am a railing alongside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp 
me may grasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not. 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



7. Reading and Writing 



OF ALL that is written, I love only what a person hath written 
with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood 
is spirit. 

It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the 
reading idlers. 

He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the 
reader. Another century of readers and spirit itself will stink. 

Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long 
run not only writing but also thinking. 

Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even 
becometh populace. 

He that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be 
read, but learnt by heart. 

In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but 
for that route thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be 
peaks, and those spoken to should be big and tall. 

The atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit 
full of a joyful wickedness: thus are things well matched. 

I want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. The 



4O THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

courage which scareth away ghosts, createth for itself goblins 
it wanteth to laugh. 

I no longer feel in common with you; the very cloud which I 
see beneath me, the blackness and heaviness at which I laugh 
that is your thunder-cloud. 

Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; and I look down 
ward because I am exalted. 

Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted? 

He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all 
tragic plays and tragic realities. 

Courageous, unconcerned, scornful, coercive so wisdom 
wisheth us; she is a woman, and ever loveth only a warrior. 

Ye tell me, "Life is hard to bear." But for what purpose 
should ye have your pride in the morning and your resigna 
tion in the evening? 

Life is hard to bear: but do not affect to be so delicate! We 
are ail of us fine sumpter asses and she-asses. 

What have we in common with the rose-bud, which 
trembleth because a drop of dew hath formed upon it? 

It is true we love life; not because we are wont to live, but 
because we are wont to love. 

There is always some madness in love. But there is always, 
also, some method in madness. 

And to me also, who appreciate life, the butterflies, and 
soap-bubbles, and whatever is like them amongst us, seem most 
to enjoy happiness. 

To see these light, foolish, pretty, lively little sprites flit 
about that moveth Zarathustra to tears and songs. 

I should only believe in a God that would know how to 
dance. 

And when I saw rny devil, J found him serious, thorough, 



THETREEONTHEHILL 41 

profound, solemn : he was the spirit of gravity through him 
all things fall. 

Not by wrath, but by laughter, do we slay. Come, let us slay 
the spirit of gravity! 

I learned to walk; since then have I let myself run. I learned 
to fly; since then I do not need pushing in order to move from a 
spot. 

Now am I light, now do I fly; now do I see myself under 
myself. Now there danceth a God in me. 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



8. The Tree on the Hill 



ZARATHUSTRA S eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided 
him. And as he walked alone one evening over the hills sur 
rounding the town called "The Pied Cow," behold, there 
found he the youth sitting leaning against a tree, and gazing 
with wearied look into the valley. Zarathustra thereupon laid 
hold of the tree beside which the youth sat, and spake thus: 

"If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not 
be able to do so. 

But the wind, which we see not, troubleth and bendeth it a- 
it listeth. We are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands." 

Thereupon the youth arose disconcerted, and said: "I hear 
Zarathustra, and just now was I thinking of him!" Zarathustra 
answered : 

"Why art thou frightened on that account? But it is the 
same with man as with the tree. 



42 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the 
more vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, 
into the dark and deep into the evil." 

"Yea, into the evil!" cried the youth. "How is it possible 
that thou hast discovered my soul?" 

Zarathustra smiled, and said: "Many a soul one will never 
discover, unless one first invent it." 

"Yea, into the evil!" cried the youth once more. 

"Thou saidst the truth, Zarathustra. I trust myself no longer 
since I sought to rise into the height, and nobody trusteth me 
*ny longer; how doth that happen? 

I change too quickly: my to-day refuteth my yesterday. I 
often overleap the steps when I clamber; for so doing, none of 
the steps pardons me. 

When aloft, I find myself always alone. No one speaketh 
unto me; the frost of solitude maketh me tremble. What do I 
seek on the height? 

My contempt and my longing increase together; the higher 
I clamber, the more do I despise him who clambereth. What 
doth he seek on the height? 

How ashamed I am of my clambering and stumbling! How 
I mock at my violent panting! How I hate him who flieth! How 
tired I am on the height!" 

Here the youth was silent. And Zarathustra. contemplated 
the tree beside which they stood, and spake thus: 

"This tree standeth lonely here on the hills; it hath grown 
up high above man and beast. 

And if it wanted to speak, it would have none who could 
understand it: so high hath it grown. 

Now it waiteth and waiteth, for what doth it wait? It 
dwelleth too close to the seat of the clouds; it waiteth perhaps 
for the first lightning?" 



THE TREE ON THE HILL 43 

When Zarathustra had said this, the youth called out with 
violent gestures: "Yea, Zarathustra, thou speakest the truth. 
My destruction I longed for, when I desired to be on the 
height, and thou art the lightning for which I waited! Lo! 
what have I been since thou hast appeared amongst us? It is 
mine envy of thee that hath destroyed me!" Thus spake the 
youth, and wept bitterly. Zarathustra, however, put his arm 
about him, and led the youth away with him. 

And when they had walked a while together, Zarathustra 
began to speak thus : 

It rendeth my heart. Better than thy words express it, thine 
eyes tell me all thy danger. 

As yet thou art not free; thou still seekest freedom. Too un- 
slept hath thy seeking made thee, and too wakeful. 

On the open height wouldst thou be; for the stars thirsteth 
thy soul. But thy bad impulses also thirst for freedom. 

Thy wild dogs want liberty; they bark for joy in their cellar 
when thy spirit endeavoureth to open all prison doors. 

Still art thou a prisoner it seemeth to me who deviseth 
liberty for himself: ah! sharp becometh the soul of such 
prisoners, but also deceitful and wicked. 

To purify himself, is still necessary for the freedman of 
the spirit. Much of the prison and the mould still remaineth

Yea, I know thy danger. But by my love and hope I con 
jure thee: cast not thy love and hope away! 

Noble thou feelest thyself still, and noble others also feel 
thee still, though they bear thee a grudge and cast evil lookb. 
Know this, that to everybody a noble one standeth in the way. 

Also to the good, a noble one standeth in the way: and even 
when they call him a good roan, they want thereby to put him 
aside.

The new, would the noble man create, and a new virtue. 
The old, wanteth the good man, and that the old should be 
conserved. 

But it is not the danger of the noble man to turn a good 
man, but lest he should become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a de 
stroyer. 

Ah! I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope. 
And then they disparaged all high hopes. 

Then lived they shamelessly in temporary pleasures, and 
beyond the day had hardly an aim. 

"Spirit is also voluptuousness," said they. Then broke the 
wings of their spirit; and now it creepeth about, and defileth 
where it gnaweth. 

Once they thought of becoming heroes; but sensualists are 
they now. A trouble and a terror is the hero to them. 

But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not away the 
hero in thy soul! Maintain holy thy highest hope! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



The Preachers of Death 



THERE are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to 
whom desistance from life must be preached. 

Full is the earth of the superfluous; marred is life by the 
many-too-many. May they be decoyed out of this life by the 
"life eternal"! 
- "The yellow ones": so are called the preachers of death, or 



THE PREACHERS OF DEATH 45 

"the black ones." But I will show them unto you in other 
colours besides. 

There are the terrible ones who carry about in themselves 
the beast of prey, and have no choice except lusts or self- 
laceration. And even their lusts are self-laceration. 

They have not yet become men, those terrible ones: may 
they preach desistance from life, and pass away themselves! 

There are the spiritually consumptive ones : hardly are they 
born when they begin to die, and long for doctrines oi lassi 
tude and renunciation. 

They would fain be dead, and we should approve of their 
wish! Let us beware of awakening those dead ones, and of 
damaging those living coffins! 

They meet an invalid, or an old man, or a corpse and im 
mediately they say: "Life is refuted! 

But they only are refuted, and their eye, which seeth only 
one aspect of existence. 

Shrouded in thick melancholy, and eager for the little 
casualties that bring death : thus do they wait, and clench their 
teeth. 

Or else, they grasp at sweetmeats, and mock at their childish 
ness thereby: they cling to their straw of life, and mock at their 
still clinging to it. 

Their wisdom speaketh thus: "A fool, he who remaineth 
alive; but so far are we fools! And that is the foolishest thing 
in life!" 

"Life is only suffering": so say others, and lie not. Then see 
to it that ye cease! See to it that the life ceaseth which is only 
suffering! 

And let this be the teaching of your virtue: "Thou shalt 
slay thyself! Thou shalt steal away from thyself!" 



46 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

"Lust is sin," so say some who preach death "let us go 
apart and beget no children!" 

"Giving birth is troublesome," say others "why still give 
birth? One beareth only the unfortunate!" And they also are 
preachers of death. 

"Pity is necessary," so saith a third party. "Take what I 
have! Take what I am! So much less doth life bind me!" 

Were they consistently pitiful, then would they make their 
neighbours sick of life. To be wicked that would be their true 
goodness. 

But they want to be rid of life; what care they if they bind 
others still faster with their chains and gifts! 

And ye also, to whom life is rough labour and disquiet, are 
ye not very tired of life? Are ye not very ripe for the sermon 
of death? 

All ye to whom rough labour is dear, and the rapid, new, 
and strange ye put up with yourselves badly; your diligence is 
flight, and the will to self-forgetfulness. 

If ye believed more in life, then would ye devote yourselves 
less to the momentary. But for waiting, ye have not enough of 
capacity in you nor even for idling! 

Everywhere resoundeth the voices of those who preach 
death; and the earth is full of those to whom death hath to be 
preached. 

Or "life eternal"; it is all the same to me if only they pass 
iway quickly! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



WAR AND WARRIORS 47 

10. War and Warriors 



BY OUR best enemies we do not want to be spared, nor by 
those either whom we love from the very heart. So let me tell 
you the truth! 

My brethren in war! I love you from the very heart. I am, 
and \vas ever, your counterpart. And I am also your best enemy. 
So let me tell you the truth! 

I know the hatred and envy of your hearts. Ye are not great 
enough not to know of hatred and envy. Then be great enough 
not to be ashamed of them! 

And if ye cannot be saints of knowledge, then, I pray you, 
be at least its warriors. They are the companions and fore 
runners of such saintship. 

I see many soldiers; could I but see many warriors! "Uni 
form" one calleth what they wear; may it not be uniform what 
they therewith hide! 

Ye shall be those whose eyes ever seek for an enemy for 
your enemy. And with some of you there is hatred at first sight. 

Your enemy shall ye seek; your war shall ye wage, and for 
the sake of your thoughts! And if your thoughts succumb 
your uprightness shall still shout triumph thereby! 

Ye shall love peace as a means to new wars and the short 
peace more than the long. 

You I advise not to work, but to fight. You I advise not to 
peace, but to victory. Let your work be a fight, let your peace 
be a victory! 

One can only be silent and sit peacefully when one hath 
arrow and bow; otherwise one prateth and quarrelleth. Let 
your peace be a vktory!

Ye say it is the good cause which halloweth even war? I say 
unto you : it is the good war which halloweth every cause. 

War and courage have done more gieat things than charity. 
Not your sympathy, but your bravery hath hitherto saved the 
victims. 

"What is good?" ye ask. To be brave is good. Let the little 
girls say: "To be good is what is pretty, and at the same time 
touching." 

They call you heartless: but your heart is true, and I love 
the bashfulness of your goodwill. Ye are ashamed of your flow, 
and others are ashamed of their ebb. 

Ye are ugly? Well then, my brethren, take the sublime about 
you, the mantle of the ugly! 

And when your soul becometh great, then doth it become 
haughty, and in your sublimity there is wickedness. I know you. 

In wickedness the haughty man and the weakling meet. 
But they misunderstand one another. I know you. 

Ye shall only have enemies to be hated, but not enemies to 
be despised. Ye must be proud of your enemies; then, the suc 
cesses of your enemies are also your successes. 

Resistance that is the distinction of the slave. Let your 
distinction be obedience. Let your commanding itself be obey 
ing! 

To the good warrior soundeth "thou shalt" pleasant er than 
"I will." And all that is dear unto you, ye shall first have it 
commanded unto you. 

Let your love to life be love to your highest hope; and let 
your highest hope be the highest thought of life! 

Your highest thought, however, ye shall have it commanded 
unto you by me and it is this : man is something that is to be 
surpassed.

//. The New Idol 



SOMEWHERE there are still peoples and herds, but not with us, 
my brethren: here there are states. 

A state? What is that? Well! open now your ears unto me, 
for now will I say unto you my word concerning the death of 
peoples. 

A state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth 
it also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: "I, the state, am 
the people." 

It is a lie! Creators were they who created peoples, and hung 
a faith and a love over them : thus they served life. 

Destroyers, are they who lay snares for many, and call it the 
state: they hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them. 

Where there is still a people, there the state is not under 
stood, but hated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and 
customs. 

This sign I give unto you: every people speaketh its lan 
guage of good and evil : this its neighbour understandeth not. 
Its language hath it devised for itself in laws and customs. 

But the state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and 
whatever it saith it Jieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen.

False is everything in it; with stolen teeth it biteth, the

dicateth this sign! Verily, it beckoneth unto the preachers of 
death! 

Many too many are born: for the superfluous ones was the 
state devised! 

See just how it enticeth them to it, the many-too-many! How 
it swalloweth and cheweth and recheweth them! 

"On earth there is nothing greater than I : it is I who am the 
regulating finger of God thus roareth the monster. And not 
only the long-eared and short-sighted fall upon their knees! 

Ah! even in your ears, ye great souls, it whispereth its 
gloomy lies! Ah! it findeth out the rich hearts which willingly 
lavish themselves! 

Yea, it findeth you out too, ye conquerors of the old God! 
Weary ye became of the conflict, and now your weariness 
serveth the new idol! 

Heroes and honourable ones, it would fain set up around it,

sciences, the cold monster! 

Everything will it give you, if ye worship it, the new idol : 
thus it purchaseth the lustre of your virtue, and the glance ot 
your proud eyes. 

It seeketh to allure by means of you, the many-too-many* 
Yea, a hellish artifice hath here been devised, a death-horse

Just see these superfluous ones! They steal the works of the 
inventors and the treasures of the wise. Culture, they call their 
theft and everything becometh sickness and trouble unto 
them! 

Just see these superfluous ones! Sick are they always; they 
vomit their bile and call it a newspaper. They devour one an 
other, and cannot even digest themselves. 

Just see these superfluous ones! Wealth they acquire and 
become poorer thereby. Power they seek for, and above all, the 
lever of power, much money these impotent ones! 

See them clamber, these nimble apes! They clamber over one 
another, and thus scuffle into the mud and the abyss. 

Towards the throne they all strive: it is their madness as if 
happiness sat on the throne! Of ttimes sitteth filth on the throne. 
and of ttimes also the throne on filth. 

Madmen they all seem to me, and clambering apes, and too 
eager. Badly smelleth their idol to me, the cold monster: badly 
they all smell to me, these idolaters. 

My brethren, will ye suffocate in the fumes of their maws 
and appetites! Better break the windows and jump into the 
open air! 

Do go out of the way of the bad odour! Withdraw from the 
idolatry of the superfluous! 

Do go out of the way of the bad odour! Withdraw from 
the steam of these human sacrifices! 

Open still remaineth the earth for great souls. Empty are

There, where the state ceaseth pray look thither, my

12. The Flies in the Market-Place 



FLEE, my friend, into thy solitude! I see thee deafened with 
the noise of the great men, and stung all over with the stings 
of the little ones. 

Admirably do forest and rock know how to be silent with 
thee. Resemble again the tree which thou loves!:, the broad- 
branched one silently and attentively it o erhangeth the sea. 

Where solitude endeth, there beginneth the market-place; 
and where the market-place beginneth, there beginneth also 
the noise of the great actors, and the buzzing of the poison-flies. 

In the world even the best things are worthless without those 
who represent them: those representers, the people call great 
men. 

Little do the people understand what is greaf that is to 
say, the creating agency. But they have a taste for ail repre- 
centers and actors of great things. 



THE FLIES IN THE MARKET-PLACE 53 

Around the devisers of new values revolveth the world: 
invisibly it revolveth. But around the actors revolve the people 
and the glory: such is the course of things. 

Spirit, hath the actor, but little conscience of the spirit. He 
believeth always in that wherewith he maketh believe most 
strongly in himself! 

Tomorrow he hath a new belief, and the day after, one still 
newer. Sharp perceptions hath he, like the people, and change 
able humours. 

To upset that meaneth with him to prove. To drive mad- - 
that meaneth with him to convince. And blood is counted by 
him as the best of all arguments. 

A truth which only glideth into fine ears, he calleth false 
hood and trumpery. Verily, he believeth only in gods that 
make a great noise in the world! 

Full of clattering buffoons is the market-place, and the 
people glory in their great men! These are for them the masters 
of the hour. 

But the hour presseth them; so they press thee. And also 
from thee they want Yea or Nay. Alas! thou wouldst set thy 
chair betwixt For and Against? 

On account of those absolute and impatient ones, be not 
jealous, thou lover of truth! Never yet did truth cling to the 
arm of an absolute one. 

On account of those abrupt ones, return into thy security: 
only in the market-place is one assailed by Yea? or Nay? 

Slow is the experience of all deep fountains : long have they 
to wait until they know what hath fallen into their depths. 

Away from the market-place and from fame taketh place all 
that is great: away from the market-place and from fame have 
ever dwelt the devisers of new values.

Flee into thy solitude! Thou hast lived too closely to the 
small and the pitiable. Flee from their invisible vengeance! 
Towards thee they have nothing but vengeance. 

Raise no longer an arm against them! Innumerable are they, 
and it is not thy lot to be a fly-flap. 

Innumerable are the small and pitiable ones; and of many a 
proud structure, rain-drops and weeds have been the ruin. 

Thou art not stone; but already hast thou become hollow 
by the numerous drops. Thou wilt yet break and burst by the 
numerous drops. 

Exhausted I see thee, by poisonous flies; bleeding I see 
thee, and torn at a hundred spots; and thy pride will not even 
upbraid. 

Blood they would have from thee in all innocence; blood 
their bloodless souls crave for and they sting, therefore, in 
all innocence. 

But thou, profound one, thou sufferest too profoundly even 
from small wounds; and ere thou hadst recovered, the same 
poison- worm crawled over thy hand. 

Too proud art thou to kill these sweet- tooths. But take care 
lest it be thy fate to suffer all their poisonous injustice! 

They buzz around thee also with their praise: obtrusiveness 
is their praise. They want to be close to thy skin and thy blood. 

They flatter thee, as one flattereth a God or devil; they 
whimper before thee, as before a God or devil. What doth it 
come to! Flatterers are they, and whimperers, and nothing 
more. 

Often, also, do they show themselves to thee as amiable ones. 



THE FLIES IN THE MARKET-PLACE 55 

But that hath ever been the prudence of the cowardly. Yea! 
the cowardly are wise! 

They think much about thee with their circumscribed souls 
thou art always suspected by them! Whatever is much 
thought about is at last thought suspicious. 

They punish thee for all thy virtues. They pardon thee in 
their inmost hearts only for thine errors. 

Because thou art gentle and of upright character, thou 
sayest: "Blameless are they for their small existence." But their 
circumscribed souls think: "Blamable is all great existence." 

Even when thou art gentle towards them, they still feel 
themselves despised by thee; and they repay thy beneficence 
with secret maleficence. 

Thy silent pride is always counter to their taste; they rejoice 
if once thou be humble enough to be frivolous. 

What we recognise in a man, we also irritate in him. There 
fore be on your guard against the small ones! 

In thy presence they feel themselves small, and their base 
ness gleameth and gloweth against thee in invisible vengeance. 

Sawest thou not how often they became dumb when thou 
approachedst them, and how their energy left them like the 
smoke of an extinguishing fire? 

Yea, my friend, the bad conscience art thou of thy neigh 
bours; for they are unworthy of thee. Therefore they hate thee, 
and would fain suck thy blood. 

Thy neighbours will always be poisonous flies; what is great 
in thee that itself must make them more poisonous, and 
always more fly-like. 

Flee, my friend, into thy solitude and thither, where a 
rough strong breeze bloweth. It is not thy lot to be a fly-flap.

jj. Chastity 

I LOVE the forest. It is bad to live in cities : there, there are toe

Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer than 
into the dreams of a lustful woman? 

And just look at these men: their eye saith it they know 
nothing better on earth than to lie with a woman. 

Filth is at the bottom of their souls; and alas! if their filth 
hath still spirit in it! 

Would that ye were perfect at least as animals! But to 
animals belongeth innocence. 

Do I counsel you to slay your instincts? I counsel you to 
innocence in your instincts. 

Do I counsel you to chastity? Chastity is a virtue with some, 
but with many almost a vice. 

These are continent, to be sure: but doggish lust looketh 
enviously out of all that they do. 

Even into the heights of their virtue and into their cold spirit 
doth this creature follow them, with its discord. 

And how nicely can doggish lust beg for a piece of spirit, 
when a piece of flesh is denied it! 

Ye love tragedies and all that breaketh the heart? But I am 
distrustful of your doggish lust. 

Ye have too cruel eyes, and ye look wantonly towards the 
sufferers. Hath not your lust just disguised itself and taken the 
name of fellow-suffering? 

And also this parable give I unto you: Not a tew who meant 
to cast out their devil, went thereby into the swine themselves

Tc whom chastity is difficult, it is to be dissuaded : lest it be

Do I speak of filthy things? That is noi: the worst thing for 
me to do. 

Not when the truth is filthy, but when it is shallow, doth the 
discerning one go unwillingly into its waters. 

Verily, there are chaste ones from their very nature; they 
are gentler of heart, and laugh better and oftener than you. 

They laugh also at chastity, and ask: "What is chastity? 

Is chastity not folly? But the folly came unto us, and not we 
unto it. 

We offered that guest harbour and heart: now it dwelleth 
with us let it stay as long as it will!"- 

Thus spake Zarathustra.

"ONE is always too many about me" thinketh the anchorite. 
"Always once one that maketh two in the long run!" 

I and me are always too earnestly in conversation: how 
could it be endured, if there were not a friend? 

The friend of the anchorite is always the third one: the 
third one is the cork which preventeth the conversation of the 
two sinking into the depth. 

Ah! there are too many depths for all anchorites. Therefore, 
do they long so much for a friend and for his elevation. 

Our faith in others betrayeth wherein we would fain have 
faith in ourselves Our longing for a friend is our betrayer.

And often with our love we want merely to overleap envy. 
And often we attack and make ourselves enemies, to conceal 
that we are vulnerable. 

"Be at least mine enemy!" thus speaketh the true rever 
ence, which doth not venture to solicit friendship. 

If one would have a friend, then must one also be willing 
to wage war for him: and in order to wage war, one must be 
capable of being an enemy. 

One ought still to honour the enemy in one s friend. Canst 
thou go nigh unto thy friend, and not go over to him? 

In one s friend one shall have one s best enemy. Thou shalt 
be closest unto him with thy heart when thou withstandest him. 

Thou wouldst wear no raiment before thy friend? It is in 
honour of thy friend that thou showest thyself to him as thou 
art? But he wisheth thee to the devil on that account! 

He who maketh no secret of himself shocketh: so much 
reason have ye to fear nakedness! Aye, if ye were gods, ye 
could then be ashamed of clothing! 

Thou canst not adorn thyself fine enough for thy friend; 
for thou shalt be unto him an arrow and a longing for the 
Superman. 

Sawest thou ever thy friend asleep to know how he 
looketh? What is usually the countenance of thy friend? It is 
thine own countenance, in a coarse and imperfect mirror. 

Sawest thou ever thy friend asleep? Wert thou not dis 
mayed at thy friend looking so? O my friend, man is some 
thing that hath to be surpassed. 

In divining and keeping silence shall the friend be a master: 
not everything must thou wish to see. Thy dream shall dis 
close unto thee what thy friend doeth when awake. 

Let thy pity be a divining: to know first if thy frieno

wanteth pity. Perhaps he loveth in thee the unmoved eye, and 
the look of eternity. 

Let thy pity for thy friend be hid under a hard shell; thou 
shalt bite out a tooth upon it. Thus will it have delicacy and 
sweetness. 

Art thou pure air and solitude and bread and medicine to 
thy friend? Many a one cannot loosen his own fetters, but is 
nevertheless his friend s emancipator. 

Art thou a slave? Then thou canst not be a friend. Art tnou 
a tyrant? Then thou canst not have friends. 

Far too long hath there been a slave and a tyrant concealed 
in woman. On that account woman is not yet capable of friend 
ship: she knoweth only love. 

In woman s love there is injustice and blindness to all she 
doth not love. And even in woman s conscious love, there is 
still always surprise and lightning and night, along with the 
light. 

As yet woman is not capable of friendship : women are still 
cats and birds. Or at the best, cows. 

As yet woman is not capable of friendship. But tell me, ye 
men, who of you is capable of friendship? 

Oh! your poverty, ye men, and your sordidness of soul! As 
much as ye give to your friend, will I give even to my foe, 
will not have become poorer thereby. 

There is comradeship: may there be friendship!

/j. The Thousand and One Goals 

MANY lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples: thus he dis- 
&lt;.overed the good and bad of many peoples. No greater power 
&lt;lid Zarathustra find on earth than good and bad. 

No people could live without frst valuing; if a people will 
maintain itself, however, it must not value as its neighbour 
valueth. 

Much that passed for good with one people was regarded 
with scorn and contempt by another: thus I found it. Much 
found I here called bad, which was there decked with purple 
honours. 

Never did the one neighbour understand the other: ever 
did his soul marvel at his neighbour s delusion and wickedness. 

A table of excellencies hangeth over every people. Lo! it is 
the table of their triumphs; lo! it is the voice of their Will to 
Power. 

It is laudable, what they think hard; what is indispensable 
and hard they call good; and what relieveth in the direst dis 
tress, the unique and hardest of all, they extol as holy. 

Whatever maketh them rule and conquer and shine, to the 
dismay and envy of their neighbours, they regard as the high 
and foremost thing, the test and the meaning of all else. 

Verily, my brother, if thou knewest but a people s need, its 
land, its sky, and its neighbour, then wouldst thou divine the 
law of its surmountings, and why it climbeth up that ladder to 
its hope. 

"Always shalt thou be the foremost and prominent above 
others: no one shall thy jealous soul love, except a friend"

that made the soul of a Greek thrill: thereby went he his way 
to greatness. 

"To speak truth, and be skilful with bow and arrow" so 
seemed it alike pleasing and hard to the people from whom 
cometh my name the name which is alike pleasing and hard 
to me. 

"To honour father and mother, and from the root of the soui 
to do their will" this table of surmounting hung another 
people over them, and became powerful and permanent there- 

by. 

"To have fidelity, and for the sake of fidelity to risk honour 
and blood, even in evil and dangerous courses" teaching it 
self so, another people mastered itself, and thus mastering 
itself, became pregnant and heavy with great hopes. 

Verily, men have given unto themselves all their good and 
bad. Verily, they took it not, they found it not, it came not unto 
them as a voice from heaven. 

Values did man only assign to things in order to maintain 
himself he created only the significance of things, a human 
significance! Therefore, calleth he himself "man," that is, the 
valuator. 

Valuing is creating: hear it, ye creating ones! Valuation 
itself is the treasure and jewel of the valued things. 

Through valuation only is there value; and without valua 
tion the nut of existence would be hollow. Hear it, ye creating 
ones! 

Change of values that is, change of the creating ones. 
Always doth he destroy who hath to be a creator. 

Creating ones were first of all peoples, and only in late 
times individuals; verily, the individual himself is still the 
latest creation. 

Peoples once hung over them tables of the good. Love which 



62 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

would rule and love which would obey, created for themselves 
such tables. 

Older is the pleasure in the herd than the pleasure in the 
ego : and as long as the good conscience is for the herd, the bad 
conscience only saith: ego. 

Verily, the crafty ego, the loveless one, that seeketh its 
advantage in the advantage of many it is not the origin of the 
herd, but its ruin. 

Loving ones, was it always, and creating ones, that created 
.good and bad. Fire of love gloweth in the names of all the 
virtues, and fire of wrath. 

Many lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples : no greater 
power did Zarathustra find on earth than the creations of the 
loving ones "good" and "bad" are they called. 

Verily, a prodigy is this power of praising and blaming. 
Tell me, ye brethren, who will master it for me? Who will put 
a fetter upon the thousand necks of this animal? 

A thousand goals have there been hitherto, for a thousand 
peoples have there been. Only the fetter for the thousand 
necks is still lacking; there is lacking the one goal. As yet 
humanity hath not a goal. 

But pray tell me, my brethren, if the goal of humanity be stil? 
lacking, is there not also still lacking humanity itself? 

Thus spake Zarathustra, 



NEIGHBOltA-LO V E 63 

16. Neighbour-Love 

YE CROWD around your neighbour, and have fine words for it 
But I say unto you: your neighbour-love is your bad love of 
yourselves. 

Ye flee unto your neighbour from yourselves, and would 
fain make a virtue thereof: but I fathom your "unselfishness." 

The Thou is older than the /; the Thou hath been conse 
crated, but not yet the /: so man presseth nigh unto his neigh 
bour. 

Do I advise you to neighbour-love? Rather do I advise you 
to neighbour-flight and to furthest love! 

Higher than love to your neighbour is love to the furthest 
and future ones; higher still than love to men, is love to things 
and phantoms. 

The phantom that runneth on before thee, my brother, is 
fairer than thou; why dost thou not give unto it thy flesh and 
thy bones? But thou fearest, and runnest unto thy neighbour. 

Ye cannot endure it with yourselves, and do not love your 
selves sufficiently: so ye seek to mislead your neighbour into 
love, and would fain gild yourselves with his error. 

Would that ye could not endure it with any kind of near 
ones, or their neighbours; then would ye have to create your 
friend and his overflowing heart out of yourselves. 

Ye call in a witness when ye want to speak well of your 
selves; and when ye have misled him to think well of you, y^ 
also think well of yourselves. 

Not only doth he lie, who speaketh contrary to his knowl 
edge, but more so, he who speaketh contrary to his ignorance. 



64 I HUS SPAKE ZARATHU5, TRA 

And thus speak ye of yourselves in your intercourse,, and belie 
your neighbour with yourselves. 

Thus saith tLe fool: "Association with men spoileth the 
character, especially when one hath none. 

The one goeth to his neighbour because he seeketh him 
self, and the other because he would fain lose himself. Your 
bad love to yourselves maketh solitude a prison to you. 

The furthest ones are they who pay for your love to the 
near ones; and when there arc but five of you together, a sixth 
must always die. 

I love not your festivals either: too many actors found I 
there, and even the spectators often behaved like actors. 

Not the neighbour do I teach you, but the friend. Let the 
friend be the festival of the earth to you, and a foretaste of 
the Superman. 

I teach you the friend and his overflowing heart. But one 
must know how to be a sponge, if one would be loved by over 
flowing hearts. 

I teach you the friend in whom the world standeth complete, 
a capsule of the good, the creating friend, who hath always a 
complete world to bestow. 

And as the world unrolled itself for him, so rolleth it to 
gether again for him in rings, as the growth of good through 
evil, as the growth of purpose out of chance. 

Let the future and the furthest be the motive of thy today; 
in thy friend shalt thou love the Superman as thy motive. 

My brethren, I advise you not to neighbour-love I advise 
fou to furthest love! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



..HE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE 65 

17. The Way of the Creating One 

WOULDST thou ge into isolation, my brother? Wouldst thop 
seek the way unto thyself? Tarry yet a little and hearken unto 
me. 

"Ke who seeketh may easily get lost himself. All isolation 
is wrong" : so say the herd. And long didst thou belong to the 
herd. 

The voice of the herd will still echo in thee. And when thou 
sayest, "I have no longer a conscience in. common with you," 
then will it be a plaint and a pain. 

Lo, that pain itself did the same conscience produce; and 
the last gleam of that conscience still gloweth on thine afflic^ 
tion. 

But thou wouldst go the way of thine affliction, which is the 
way unto thyself? Then show me thine authority and thy 
strength to do so! 

Art thou a new strength and a new authority? A first 
motion? A self -rolling wheel? Canst thou also compel stars 
to revolve around thee? 

Alas! there is so much lusting for loftiness! There are so 
many convulsions of the ambitions! Show me that thou art not 
a lusting and ambitious one! 

Alas! there are so many great thoughts that do nothing more 
than the bellows: they inflate, and make emptier than ever. 

Free, dost thou call thyself? Thy ruling thought would I 
hear of, and not that thou hast escaped from a yoke. 

Art thou one entitled to escape from a yoke? Many a one 
hath cast away his final worth when he hath cast away his 
servitude. 



66 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Free from what? What doth that matter to Zarathustra! 
Clearly, however, shall thine eye show unto me: free for what? 

Canst thou give unto thyself thy bad and thy good, and set 
up thy will as a law over thee? Canst thou be judge for thyself, 
and avenger of thy law? 

Terrible is aloneness with the judge and avenger of one s 
own law. Thus is a star projected into desert space, and into the 
icy breath of aloneness. 

To-day sufferest thou still from the multitude, thou individ 
ual; to-day hast thou still thy courage unabated, and thy hopes. 

But one day will the solitude weary thee; one day will thy 
pride yield, and thy courage quail. Thou wilt one day cry: "I 
am alone!" 

One day wilt thou see no longer thy loftiness, and see too 
closely thy lowliness; thy sublimity itself will frighten thee as 
a phantom. Thou wilt one day cry: "All is false!" 

There are feelings which seek to slay the lonesome one; if 
they do not succeed, then must they themselves die! But art 
thou capable of it to be a murderer? 

Hast thou ever known, my brother, the word "disdain"? 
And the anguish of thy justice in being just to those that dis 
dain thee? 

Thou forcest many to think differently about thee; that, 
charge they heavily to thine account. Thou earnest nigh unto 
them, and yet wentest past: for that they never forgive thee. 

Thou goest beyond them: but the higher thou risest, the 
smaller doth the eye of envy see thee. Most of all, however, is 
the flying one hated. 

"How could ye be just unto me!" must thou say "I 
choose your injustice as my allotted portion." 

Injustice and filth cast they at the lonesome one: but, my 



THE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE 67 

brother, if thou wouldst be a star, thou must shine for them 
none the less on that account! 

And be on thy guard against the good and just! They would 
fain crucify those who devise their own virtue they hate the 
lonesome ones. 

Be on thy guard, also, against holy simplicity! All is unholy 
to it that is not simple; fain, likewise, would it play with the 
fire of the fagot and stake. 

And be on thy guard, also, against the assaults of thy love! 
Too readily doth the recluse reach his hand to any one who 
meeteth him. 

To many a one mayest thou not give thy hand, but only thy 
paw; and I wish thy paw also to have claws. 

But the worst enemy thou canst meet, wilt thou thyself 
always be; thou waylayest thyself in caverns and forests. 

Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way to thyself! And 
past thyself and thy seven devils leadeth thy way! 

A heretic wilt thou be to thyself, and a wizard and a sooth 
sayer, and a fool, and a doubter, and a reprobate, and a villain. 

Ready must thou be to burn thyself in thine own flame; how 
couldst thou become new if thou have not first become ashes! 

Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way of the creating one: 
a God wilt thou create for thyself out of thy seven devils! 

Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way of the loving one: 
thou lovest thyself, and on that account despisest thou thyself, 
as only the loving ones despise. 

To create, desireth the loving one, because he despiseth! 
What knoweth he of love who hath not been obliged to despise 
just what he loved! 

With thy love, go into thine isolation, my brother, and with 
thy creating; and late onlv will justice limp after thee. 



68 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

With my tears, go into thine isolation, my brother. I love 
him who seeketh to create beyond himself, and thus sue- 
cumbeth. 



Thus spake Zarathustra. 



18. Old and Young Women 



WHY stealest thou along so furtively in the twilight, 
thustra? And what hidest thou so carefully under thy mantle? 

Is it a treasure that hath been given thee? Or a child that 
nath been born thee? Or goest thou thyself on a thief s errand, 
thou friend of the evil? 

Verily, my brother, said Zarathustra, it is a treasure that 
hath been given me: it is a little truth which I carry. 

But it is naughty, like a young child; and if I hold not its 
mouth, it screameth too loudly. 

As I went on my way alone today, at the hour when the 
tun declineth, there met me an old woman, and she spake thus 
unto my soul : 

"Much hath Zarathustra spoken also to us women, but 
never spake he unto us concerning woman." 

And I answered her: "Concerning woman, one should only 
talk unto men." 

"Talk also unto me of woman," said she; "I am old enough 
to forget it presently." 

And I obliged the old woman and spake thus unto her: 

Everything in woman is a riddle, and everything in woman 
liath one solution it is called pregnancy. 



OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN 69 

Man is for woman a means: the purpose is always the child. 
But what is woman for man? 

Two different things wanteth the true man: danger and 
diversion. Therefore wanteth he woman, as the most danger 
ous plaything. 

* Man shall be trained for war, and woman for the recreation 
of the warrior: all else is folly. 

Too sweet fruits these the warrior liketh not. Therefore 
liketh he woman; bitter is even the sweetest woman. 

Better than man doth woman understand children, but man 
is more childish than woman. 

In the true man there is a child hidden: it wanteth to play. 
Up then, ye women, and discover the child in man! 

A plaything let woman be, pure and fine like the precious 
stone, illumined with the virtues of a world not yet come. 

Let the beam of a star shine in your love! Let your hope say: 
"May I bear the Superman!" 

In your love let there be valour! With your love shall ye 
assail him who inspireth you with fear! 

In your love be your honour! Little doth woman understand 
otherwise about honour. But let this be your honour: always 
to love more than ye are loved, and never be the second. 

Let man fear woman when she loveth: then maketh she 
every sacrifice, and everything else she regardeth as worthless. 

Let man fear woman when she hateth : for man in his inner 
most soul is merely evil; woman, however, is mean. 

Whom hateth woman most? Thus spake the iron to the 
loadstone: "I hate thee most, because thou attractest, but art 
too weak to draw unto thee." 

The happiness of man is, "I will." The happiness of woman 
is, "He will." 



70 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

"Lo! now hath the world become perfect!" thus thinketh 
every woman when she obeyeth with all her love. 

Obey, must the woman, and find a depth for her surface. 
Surface is woman s soul, a mobile, stormy film on shallow 
water. 

Man s soul, however, is deep, its current gusheth in subter 
ranean caverns : woman surmiseth its force, but comprehended! 
it not. 

Then answered me the old woman: Many fine things hath 
Zarathustra said, especially for those who are young enough 
for them. 

Strange! Zarathustra knoweth little about woman, and yet 
he is right about them! Doth this happen, because with women 
nothing is impossible? 

And now accept a little truth by way of thanks! I am old 
enough for it! 

Swaddle it up and hold its mouth : otherwise it will scream 
too loudly, the little truth." 

"Give me, woman, thy little truth!" said I. And thus spake 
the old woman : 

"Thou goest to women? Do not forget thy whip!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



The Bite of the Adder 



ONE day had Zarathustra fallen asleep under a fig-tree, owing 
to the heat, with his arm over his face. And there came an 
adder and bit him in the neck, so that Zarathustra screamed 
with pain. When he had taken his arm from his face he looked 



THE BITE OF THE ADDER 7! 

at the serpent; and then did it recognise the eyes of Zarathustra, 
wriggled awkwardly, and tried to get away. "Not at all/ said 
Zarathustra, "as yet hast thou not received my thanks! Thou 
hast awakened me in time; my journey is yet long." "Thy 
journey is short," said the adder sadly; "my poison is fatal." 
Zarathustra smiled. "When did ever a dragon die of a serpent s 
poison?" said he. "But take thy poison back! Thou art not 
rich enough to present it to me." Then fell the adder again on 
his neck, and licked his wound. 

When Zarathustra once told this to his disciples they asked 
him: "And what, O Zarathustra, is the moral of thy story?" 
And Zarathustra answered them thus : 

The destroyer of morality, the good and just call me: my 
story is immoral. 

When, however, ye have an enemy, then return him not 
good for evil: for that would abash him. But prove that he 
hath done something good to you. 

And rather be angry than abash any one! And when ye are 
cursed, it pleaseth me not that ye should then desire to bless. 
Rather curse a little also! 

And should a great injustice befall you, then do quickly five 
small ones besides. Hideous to behold is he on whom injustice 
presseth alone. 

Did ye ever know this? Shared injustice is half justice. And 
he who can bear it, shall take the injustice upon himself! 

A small revenge is humaner than no revenge at all. And if 
the punishment be not also a right and an honour to the trans 
gressor, I do not like your punishing. 

Nobler is it to own oneself in the wrong than to establish 
one s right, especially if one be in the right. Only, one must be 
rich enough to do so. 

I do not like your cold justice; out of the eye of your judges 



J2 THUS SPAKE ZAXATHUSTRA 

diere always glanceth the executioner and his cold steel. 

Tell me: where find we justice, which is love with seeing 
eyes? 

Devise me, then, the love which not only beareth all punish 
ment, but also all guilt! 

Devise me, then, the justice which acquitteth every one 
except the judge! 

And would ye hear this likewise? To him who seeketh to be 
just from the heart, even the lie becometh philanthropy. 

But how could I be just from the heart! How can I give every 
one his own! Let this be enough for me: I give unto every one 
mine own. 

finally, my brethren, guard against doing wrong to any 
anchorite. How could an anchorite forget! How could he 
requite! 

Like a deep well is an anchorite. Easy is it to throw in a 
stone: if it should sink to the bottom, however, tell me, who 
will bring it out again? 

Guard against injuring the anchorite . If ye have done so, 
however, well then, kill him also! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



20. Child and Marriage 

I HAVE a question for thee alone, my brother: like a sounding- 
lead, cast I this question into thy soul, that I may know its 
depth. 

Thou art young, and desirest child and marriage. But I asK 
thee: Art thou a man entitled to desire a child? 



CHILD AND MARRIAGE 73 

Art thou the victorious one, the self -conqueror, the ruler of 
thy passions, the master of thy virtues? Thus do I ask thee. 

Or doth the animal speak in thy wish, and necessity? Or iso 
lation? Or discord in thee? 

I would have thy victory and freedom long for a child. 
Living monuments shalt thou build to thy victory and emanci 
pation. 

Beyond thyself shalt thou build. But first of all must thou 
be built thyself, rectangular in body and soul. 

Not only onward shalt thou propagate thyself, but upward! 
For that purpose may the garden of marriage help thee! 

A higher body shalt thou create, a first movement, a spon 
taneously rolling wheel a creating one shalt thou create. 

Marriage: so call I the will of the twain to create the one that 
is more than those who created it. The reverence for one an 
other, as those exercising such a will, call I marriage. 

Let this be the significance and the truth of thy marriage. 
But that which the many-too-many call marriage, those super 
fluous ones ah, what shall I call it? 

Ah, the poverty of soul in the twain! Ah, the filth of soul in 
the twain! Ah, the pitiable self-complacency in the twain! 

Marriage they call it all; and they say their marriages are 
made in heaven. 

Well, I do not like it, that heaven of the superfluous! No, I 
do not like them, those animals tangled in the heavenly toils! 

Far from me also be the God who limpeth thither to bless 
what he hath not matched! 

Laugh not at such marriages! What child hath not had reason 
to weep over its parents? 

Worthy did this man seem, and ripe for the meaning of the 
earth; but when I saw his wife, tn~ ~arth Deemed to me a home 
for madcaps. 



74 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Yea. 1 would that the earth shook with convulsions when a 
saint ana a goose mate with one another. 

This one went forth in quest of truth as a hero, and at last 
got for himself a small decked-up lie: his marriage he calleth it. 

That one was reserved in intercourse and chose choicely. Rut 
one time he spoilt his company for all time: his marriage he 
calleth it. 

Another sought a handmaid with the virtues of an angel. 
But all at once he became the handmaid of a woman, and now 
would he need also to become an angel. 

Careful, have I found all buyers, and all of them have astute 
eyes. But even the astutest of them buyeth his wife in a sack. 

Many short follies that is called love by you. And your 
marriage putteth an end to many short follies, with one long 
.stupidity. 

Your love to woman, and woman s love to man ah, would 
that it were sympathy for suffering and veiled deities! But 
generally two animals alight on one another. 

But even your best love is only an enraptured simile and a 
painful ardour. It is a torch to light you to loftier paths. 

Beyond yourselves shall ye love some day! Then learn first 
of all to love. And on that account ye had to drink the bitter 
cup of your love. 

Bitterness is in the cup even of the best love; thus doth it 
cause longing for the Superman; thus doth it cause thirst in 
thee, the creating one! 

Thirst in the creating one, arrow and longing for the Supei 
man: tell me, my brother, is this thy will to marriage? 

Holy call I such a will, and such a marriage. 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



VOLUNTARY DEATH 75 

21. Voluntary Death 

MANY die too late, and some die too early. Yet strange 
soundeth the precept: "Die at the right time!" 

Die at the right time : so teacheth Zarathustra. 

To be sure, he who never liveth at the right time, how coi ild 
he ever die at the right time? Would that he might never be 
born! Thus do I advise the superfluous ones. 

But even the superfluous ones make much ado about theii 
death, and even the hollowest nut wanteth to be cracked. 

Every one regardeth dying as a great matter: but as yet death 
is not a festival. Not yet have people learned to inaugurate the 
finest festivals. 

The consummating death I show unto you, which becometh 
a stimulus and promise to the living. 

His death, dieth the consummating one triumphantly, sur 
rounded by hoping and promising ones. 

Thus should one learn to die; and there should be no festival 
at which such a dying one doth not consecrate the oaths of the 
living! 

Thus to die is best; the next best, however, is to die in battle, 
and sacrifice a great soul. 

But to the fighter equally hateful as to the victor, is your 
grinning death which stealeth nigh like a thief, and yet 
cometh as master. 

My death, praise I unto you, the voluntary death, which 
cometh unto me because 7 want it. 

And when shall I want it? He that hath a goal and an heir, 
wanteth death at the right time for the goal and the heir. 



"j6 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

And out of reverence for the goal and the heir, he will hang 
up no more withered wreaths in the sanctuary of life. 

Verily, not the rope-makers will I resemble: they lengthen 
out their cord, and thereby go ever backward. 

Many a one, also, waxeth too old for his truths and 
triumphs; a toothless mouth hath no longer the right to every 
truth. 

And whoever wanteth to have fame, must take leave of 
honour betimes, and practise the difficult art of going at the 
right time. 

One must discontinue being feasted upon when one tasteth 
best: that is known by those who want to be long loved. 

Sour apples are there, no doubt, whose lot is to wait until 
the last day of autumn : and at the same time they become ripe, 
yellow, and shrivelled. 

In some ageth the heart first, and in others the spirit. And 
some are hoary in youth, but the late young keep long young. 

To many men life is a failure; a poison-worm gnaweth at 
their heart. Then let them see to it that their dying is all the 
more a success. 

Many never become sweet; they rot even in the summer. It is 
cowardice that holdeth them fast to their branches. 

Far toe many live, and far too long hang they on their 
branches. Would that a storm came and shook all this rotten 
ness and worm-eatenness from the tree! 

Would that there came preachers of speedy death! Those 
would be the appropriate storms and agitators of the trees of 
life! But I hear only slow death preached, and patience with all 
that is "earthly." 

Ah! ye preach patience with what is earthly? This earthly is 
it that hath too much patience with you, ye blasphemers! 



VOLUNTARY DEATH 7/ 

Verily, too early died that Hebrew whom the preachers of 
slow death honour: and to many hath it proved a calamity thai- 
he died too early. 

As yet had he known only tears, and the. melancholy of the 
Hebrews, together with the hatred of the good and just 
the Hebrew Jesus: then was he seized with the longing for 
death. 

Had he but remained in the wilderness, and far from the 
good and just! Then, perhaps, would he have learned to live, 
and love the earth and laughter also! 

Believe it, my brethren! He died too early; he himself would 
have disavowed his doctrine had he attained to my age! Noble 
enough was he to disavow! 

But he was still immature, Immaturely loveth the youth, and 
immaturely also hateth he man and earth. Confined and awk 
ward are still his soul and the wings of his spirit. 

But in man there is more of the child than in the youth, and 
less of melancholy: better understandeth he about life and 
death. 

Free for death, and free in death; a holy Naysayer, when 
there is no longer time for Yea: thus understandeth he about 
death and life. 

That your dying may not be a reproach to man and the 
earth, my friends: that do I solicit from the honey of your 
soul. 

In your dying shall your spirit and your virtue still shine like 
an evening after-glow around the earth : otherwise your dying 
hath been unsatisfactory. 

Thus will I die myself, that ye friends may love the earth 
more for my sake; and earth will I again become, to have rest 
in her that bore me. 



j8 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Verily, a goal had Zarathustra; he threw his ball. Now be ye 
friends the heirs of my goal; to you throw I the golden ball. 

Best of all, do I see you, my friends, throw the golden ball! 
And so tarry I still a little while on the earth pardon me for it! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



22. The Bestowing Virtue 



WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his 
heart was attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," 
there followed him many people who called themselves his 
disciples, and kept him company. Thus came they to a cross 
roads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now wanted to go 
alone; for he was fond of going alone. His disciples, however, 
presented him at his departure with a staff, on the golden 
handle of which a serpent twined round the sun. Zarathustra 
rejoiced on account of the staff, and supported himself thereon; 
then spake he thus to his disciples : 

Tell me, pray: how came gold to the highest value? Because 
it is uncommon, and unprofiting, and beaming, and soft in 
lustre; it always bestoweth itself. 

Only as image of the highest virtue came gold to the highest 
value. Goldlike, beameth the glance of the bestower. Gold- 
lustre maketh peace between moon and sun. 

Uncommon is the highest virtue, and unprcftting, beaming 
&lt;s it, and soft of lustre: a bestowing virtue is the highest virtue. 



THE BESTOWING VIRTUE 79 

Verily, I divine you well, my disciples : ye strive like me for 
the bestowing virtue. What should ye have in common with 
cats and wolves? 

It is your thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves : and 
tlieref ore have ye the thirst to accumulate ail riches in your soul. 

Insatiably striveth your soul for treasures and jewels, be 
cause your virtue is insatiable in desiring to bestow. 

Ye constrain all things to flow towards you and into you, 
so that they shall flow back again out of your fountain as the 
gifts of your love. 

Verily, an appropriator of all values must such bestowing 
love become; but healthy and holy, call I this selfishness. 

Another selfishness is there, an all-too-poor and hungry 
kind, which would always steal the selfishness of the sick, 
the sickly selfishness. 

With the eye of the thief it looketh upon all that is lustrous; 
with the craving of hunger it measureth him who hath abun 
dance; and ever doth it prowl round the tables of bestowers. 

Sickness speaketh in such craving, and invisible degenera 
tion; of a sickly body, speaketh the larcenous craving of this 
selfishness. 

Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of 
all? Is it not degeneration? And we always suspect degenera 
tion when the bestowing soul is lacking. 

Upward goeth our course from genera on to super-genera. 
But a horror to us is the degenerating sense, which saitn: "All 
for myself." 

Upward soareth our sense: thus is it a simile of our body, a 
simile of an ele\ a^ion. Such similes of elevations are the names 
of the virtues. 

Thus goeth the body through history, a becomer and fighter 



80 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

And the spirit what is it to the body? Its fights and victories 
herald, its companion and echo. 

Similes, are all names of good and evil; they do not speak 
out, they only hint. A fool who seeketh knowledge from them! 

Give heed, my brethren, to every hour when your spirit 
would speak in similes : there is the origin of your virtue. 

Elevated is then your body, and raised up; with its delight, 
enraptureth it the spirit; so that it becometh creator, and 
valuer, and lover, and everything s benefactor. 

When your heart overfloweth broad and full like the river, 
a blessing and a danger to the lowlanders: there is the origin 
of your virtue. 

When ye are exalted above praise and blame, and your will 
would command all things, as a loving one s will: there is the 
origin of your virtue. 

When ye despise pleasant things, and the effeminate couch, 
and cannot couch far enough from the effeminate: there is the 
origin of your virtue. 

When ye are willers of one will, and when that change of 
every need is needful to you: there is the origin of your virtue. 

Verily, a new good and evil is it! Verily, a new deep mur 
muring, and the voice of a new fountain! 

Power is it, this new virtue; a ruling thought is it, and 
around it a subtle soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of 
knowledge around it. 



Here paused Zarathustra awhile, and looked lovingly on 
his disciples. Then he continued to speak thus and his voice 
had changed: 



THE BESTOWING VIRTUE 8l 

Remain true to the earth, my brethren, with the power of 
your virtue! Let your bestowing love and your knowledge be 
devoted to be the meaning of the earth! Thus do I pray and 
conjure you. 

Let it not fly away from the earthly and beat against eternal 
walls with its wings! Ah, there hath always been so much 
flown-away virtue! 

Lead, like me, the flown-away virtue back to the earth yea, 
back to body and life: that it may give to the earth its mean 
ing, a human meaning! 

A hundred times hitherto hath spirit as well as virtue flown 
away and blundered. Alas! in our body dwelleth still all this 
delusion and blundering: body and will hath it there become. 

A hundred times hitherto hath spirit as well as virtue at 
tempted and erred. Yea, an attempt hath man been. Alas, 
much ignorance and error hath become embodied in us! 

Not only the rationality of millennia also their mad 
ness, breaketh out in us. Dangerous is it to be an heir. 

Still fight we step by step with the giant Chance, and over 
all mankind hath hitherto ruled nonsense, the lack-of -sense. 

Let your spirit and your virtue be devoted to the sense of the 
earth, my brethren: let the value of everything be determined 
anew by you! Therefore shall ye be fighters! Therefore shall 
ye be creators! 

Intelligently doth the body purify itself; attempting with 
intelligence it exalteth itself; to the discerners all impulses 
sanctify themselves; to the exalted the soul becometh joyful. 

Physician, heal thyself: then wilt thou also heal thy patient. 
Let it be his best cure to see with his eyes him who maketh 
himself whole. 

A thousand paths are there which have never yet been 
trodden; a thousand salubrities and hidden islands of life 



82 THUS SPAKffc ZARATHUSTRA 

Unexhausted and undiscovered is still man and man s world. 

Awake and hearken, ye lonesome ones! From the future 
come winds with stealthy pinions, and to fine ears good tidings 
are proclaimed. 

Ye lonesome ones of today, ye seceding ones, ye shall one 
day be a people: out of you who have chosen yourselves, shall 
a chosen people arise: and out of it the Superman. 

Verily, a place of healing shall the earth become! And 
already is a new odour diffused around it, a salvation-bringing 
xlour and a new hope! 



When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like 
one who had not said his last word; and long did he balance 
the staff doubtfully in his hand. At last he spake thus and his 
voice had changed: 

I now go alone, my disciples! Ye also now go away, and 
alone! So will I have it. 

Verily, I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves 
against Zarathustra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Per 
haps he hath deceived you. 

The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his 
enemies, but also to hate his friends. 

One requiteth a teacher badly if one remain merely a 
scholar. And why will ye not pluck at my wreath? 

Ye venerate me; but what if your veneration should some 
day collapse? Take heed lest a statue crush you! 

Ye say, ye believe in Zarathustra? But of what account is 
Zarathustra! Ye are my believers: but of what account are all 
believers! 



THE BESTOWING VIRTUE 83 

Ye had not yet sought yourselves : then did ye find me. So do 
all believers; therefore all belief is of so little account. 

Now do I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only 
when ye have all denied me, will I return unto you. 

Verily, with other eyes, my brethren, shall I then seek m 
lost ones; with another love shall I then love you. 

And once again shall ye have become friends unto me, an 
children of one hope: then will I be with you for the third tim&lt; 
to celebrate the great noontide with you. 

And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of 
his course between animal and Superman, and celebrateth his 
advance to the evening as his highest hope: for it is the ad 
vance to a new morning. 

At such time will the down-goer bless himself, that he 
should be an over-goer; and the sun of his knowledge will be 
at noontide. 

"Dead are all the Gods: now do we desire the Superman 
to live! Let this be our final will at the great noontide! 

Thus spake Zarathustra.

Virtue" (p. 92). 



23. The Child with the Mirror 



AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains tx 
the solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, 
waiting like a sower who hath scattered his seed. His soul, 
however, became impatient and full of longing for those 
whom he loved: because he had still much to give them. For 
this is hardest of all : to close the open hand out of love, and 
keep modest as a giver. 

Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his 
wisdom meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its 
abundance. 

One morning, however, he awoke ere the rosy dawn, and 
having meditated long on his couch, at last spake thus to his 
heart : 

Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a 
child come to me, carrying a mirror? 

"O Zarathustra" said the child unto me "look at thyself 
in the mirror!" 

But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart 
throbbed: for not myself did I see therein, but a devil s 
grimace and derision. 

Verily, all too well do I understand the dream s portent and 
monition: my doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called 
wheat! 

Mine enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the

likeness of my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush 
for the gifts that I gave them. 

Lost are my friends; the hour hath come for me to seek my 
lost ones! 

With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like 
a person in anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a 
singer whom the spirit inspireth. With amazement did his 
eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a coming bliss over 
spread his countenance like the rosy dawn. 

What hath happened unto me, mine animals? said Zara 
thustra. Am I not transformed? Hath not bliss come unto me 
like a whirlwind? 

Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it 
is still too young so have patience with it! 

Wounded am I by my happiness: all sufferers shall be 
physicians unto me! 

To my friends can I again go down, and also to mine 
enemies! Zarathustra can again speak and bestow, and show 
his best love to his loved ones! 

My impatient love overflowed! in streams, down towards 
sunrise and sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of 
affliction, rusheth my soul into the valleys. 

Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too 
long hath solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep 
silence. 

Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a 
brook from high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl 
my speech. 

And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented 
channels! How should a stream not finally find its way to the 
sea! 



THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR 89 

Forsooth, there is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; 
but the stream of my love beareth this along with it, down to 
the sea! 

New paths do I tread, a new speech cometh unto me; tired 
have I become like all creators of the old tongues. No 
longer will my spirit walk on worn-out soles. 

Too slowly runneth all speaking for me: into thy chariot, 
O storm, do I leap! And even thee will I whip with my spite! 

Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find 
the Happy Isles where my friends sojourn; 

And mine enemies amongst them! How I now love every 
one unto whom I may but speak! Even mine enemies pertain 
ro my bliss. 

And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then doth my 
spear always help me up best: it is my foot s ever ready 
servant: 

The spear which I hurl at mine enemies! How grateful am I 
to mine enemies that I may at last hurl it! 

Too great hath been the tension of my cloud: twixt laugh 
ters of lightnings will I cast hail-showers into the depths. 

Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow 
its storm over the mountains : thus cometh its assuagement. 

Verily, like a storm cometh my happiness, and my freedom! 
But mine enemies shall think that the evil one roareth over 
their heads. 

Yea, ye also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wis 
dom; and perhaps ye will flee therefrom, along with mine 
enemies. 

Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds 
flutes! Ah, that my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! 
And much have we already learned with one another: 

My wild wisdom became pregnant on the lonesome moun-

young. 

Now runneth she foolishly in the arid wilderness, and 
seeketh and seeketh the soft sward mine old, wild wisdom! 

On the soft sward of your hearts, my friends! on your 
love, would she fain couch her dearest one! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



24. In the Happy Isles 



THE figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in 
falling the red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe 
figs. 

Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends : 
imbibe now their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn 
all around, and clear sky, and afternoon. 

Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of 
superabundance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas. 

Once did people say God, when they looked out upon dis 
tant seas; now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman. 

God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to 
reach beyond your creating will. 

Could ye create a God? Then, I pray you, be silent about 
all gods! But ye could well create the Superman. 

Not perhaps ye yourselves, my brethren! But into fathers 
and forefathers of the Superman could ye transform your 
selves: and let that be your best creating! 



IN THE HAPPY ISLES 91 

God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing re 
stricted to the conceivable. 

Could ye conceive a God? But let this mean Will to Truth 
unto you, that everything be transformed into the humanly 
conceivable, the humanly visible, the humanly sensible! Your 
own discernment shall ye follow out to the end! 

And what ye have called th&lt;? world shall but be created by 
you: your reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it 
itself become! And verily, for your bliss, ye discerning ones! 

And how would ye endure life without that hope, ye dis 
cerning ones? Neither in the inconceivable could ye have been 
born, nor in the irrational. 

But that I may reveal my heart entirely unto you, my friends : 
// there were gods, how could 1 endure it to be no God! There 
fore there are no gods. 

Yea, I have drawn the conclusion: now, however, doth it 
draw me. 

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness 
of this conjecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from 
the creating one, and from the eagle his flights into eagle- 
heights? 

God is a thought it maketh all the straight crooked, and all 
that standeth reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the 
perishable would be but a lie? 

To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and 
even vomiting to the stomach : verily, the reeling sickness do 
I call it, to conjecture such a thing. 

Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about 
the one, and the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient 
and the imperishable! 

All the imperishable that s but a simile, and the poets lie 
too much. 



p2 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

But ot time and of becoming shall the best similes speak : a, 
praise shall they be, and a justification of all perishableness! 

Creating that is the great salvation from suffering, and 
life s alleviation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself 
is needed, and much transformation. 

Yea, much bitter dying must there be in your life s ye 
creators! Thus are ye advocates and justifiers of all perishable- 
ness. 

For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must 
also be willing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of 
the child-bearer. 

Verily, through a hundred souls went I my way, and 
through a hundred cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell 
have I taken; I know the heart-breaking last hours. 

But so willeth it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you 
it more candidly: just such a fate willeth my Will. 

All feeling suffereth in me, and is in prison: but my willing 
ever cometh to me as mine emancipator and comforter. 

Willing emancipateth : that is the true doctrine of will and 
emancipation so teacheth you Zarathustra. 

No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longei 
creating! Ah, that that great debility may ever be far from me! 

And also in discerning do I feel only my will s procreating 
,3.nd evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowl 
edge, it is because there is will to procreation in it. 

Away from God and gods did this will allure me; what 
would there be to create if there were gods! 

But to man doth it ever impel me anew, my fervent creative 
will; thus impelleth it the hammer to the stone. 

Ah, ye men, within the stone slumbereth an image for me, 
the image of my visions! Ah, that it should slumber in the 
hardest, ugliest stone! 



THE PITIFUL 93 

Now rageth my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From 
che stone fly the fragments: what s that to me? 

I will complete it: for a shadow came unto me the stillest 
and lightest of all things once came unto me! 

The beauty of the superman came unto me as a shadow. Ah, 
my brethren! Of what account now are the gods to me! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



. The Pitiful 



MY FRIENDS, there hath arisen a satire on your friend: "Be 
hold Zarathustra! Walketh he not amongst us as if amongst 
animals?" 

But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walketh 
amongst men as amongst animals." 

Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red 
cheeks. 

How hath that happened unto him? Is it not because he hath 
had to be ashamed too oft? 

O my friends! Thus speaketh the discerning one: shame, 
shame, shame that is the history of man! 

And on that account doth the noble one enjoin on him 
self not to abash: bashfulness doth he enjoin himself in 
presence of all sufferers. 

Verily, I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is 
In their pity: too destitute are they of bashfulness. 

If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so. 
it is preferably at a distance. 



94 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being 
recognised: and thus do I bid you do, my friends! 

May my destiny ever lead unafSicted ones like you across my 
path, and those with whom I may have hope and repast and 
honey in common! 

Verily, I have done this and that for the afflicted: but some 
thing better did I always seem to do when I had learned to 
enjoy myself better. 

Since humanity came into being, man hath enjoyed himself 
too little: that alone, my brethren, is our original sin! 

And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we 
unlearn best to give pain unto others, and to contrive pain. 

Therefore do I wash the hand that hach helped the sufferer; 
therefore do I wipe also my soul. 

For in seeing the sufferer suffering thereof was I ashamed 
on account of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I 
wound his pride. 

Great obligations do not make grateful, but revengeful; and 
when a small kindness is not forgotten, it becometh a gnawing 
worm. 

"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!" thus do 
I advise those who have naught to bestow. 

I, however, am a bestower: willingly do I bestow as friend 
to friends. Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for 
themselves the fruit from my tree: thus doth it cause less 
shame. 

Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! Verily, 
it annoy eth one to give unto them, and it annoy eth one not to 
give unto them. 

And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my 
friends: the sting of conscience teacheth one to sting. 



THE PITIFUL 95 

The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Verily, 
better to have done evilly than to have thought pettily! 

To be sure, ye say: "The delight in petty evils spareth one 
many a great evil deed." But here one should not wish to be 
sparing. 

Like a boil is the evil deed: it itcheth and irritateth and 
breaketh forth it speaketh honourably. 

"Behold, I am disease," saith the evil deed: that is its 
honourableness. 

But like infection is the petty thought: it creepeth and 
hideth, and wanteth to be nowhere until the whole body is 
decayed and withered by the petty infection. 

To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would 
whisper this word in the ear: "Better for thee to rear up thy 
devil! Even for thee there is still a path to greatness!" 

Ah, my brethren! One knoweth a little too much about every 
one! And many a one becometh transparent to us, but still we 
can by no means penetrate him. 

It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult. 

And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, 
but to him who doth not concern us at all. 

If, however, thou hast a suffering friend, then be a resting- 
place for his suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: 
thus wilt thou serve him best. 

And if a friend doeth thee wrong, then say: "I forgive thee 
what thou hast done unto me; that thou hast done it unto 
thyself, however how could I forgive that!" 

Thus speaketh all great love: it surpasseth even forgiveness 
and pity. 

One should hold fast one s heart; for when one lecteth it go, 
how quickly doth one s head run away! 

Ah, where in the world have th^ r ~ been greater follies than 



96 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

with the pitiful? And what in the world hath caused more 
suffering than the follies of the pitiful? 

Woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which 
is above their pity! 

Thus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: "Even God 
hath his hell: it is his love for man." 

And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: 
of his pity for man hath God died."- 

So be ye warned against pity: from thence there yet cometh 
unto men a heavy cloud! Verily, I understand weather-signs! 

But attend also to this word : All great love is above all its 
pity: for it seeketh to create what is loved! 

"Myself do I offer unto my love, and my neighbour as my 
self such is the language of all creators. 

All creators, however, are hard. 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



26. The Priests 



AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spake 
these words unto them : 

"Here are priests: but although they are mine enemies, pass 
them quietly and with sleeping swords! 

Even among them there are heroes; many of them have 
suffered too much: so they want to make others suffer. 

Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than theii 
meekness. And readily doth he soil himself who toucheth 
them. 



THE PRIESTS 97 

But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see 
rny blood honoured in theirs. "- 

And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; 
but not long had he struggled with the pain, when he began 
to speak thus : 

It moveth my heart for those priests. They also go against 
my taste; but that is the smallest matter unto me, since I am 
among men. 

But I suffer ana have suffered with them: prisoners are they 
unto me, and stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put 
them in fetters: 

In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some 
one would save them from their Saviour! 

On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea 
tossed them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster! 

False values and fatuous words: these are the worst mon 
sters for mortals long slumbereth and waiteth the fate that is 
in them. 

But at last it cometh and awaketh and devoureth and en- 
gulfeth whatever hath built tabernacles upon it. 

Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have 
built themselves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling 
caves! 

Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul 
may not fly aloft to its height! 

But so enjoineth their belief: ^On your knees, up the stair, 
ye sinners!" 

Verily, rather would I see a shameless one than the dis 
torted eyes of their shame and devotion! 

Who created for themselves such caves and penitence- 
stairs? Was it not those who sought to conceal themselves, and 
were ashamed under the clear sky? 



98 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

And only when the clear sky looketh again through ruined 
roofs, and down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls 
will I again turn my heart to the seats of this God. 

They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and 
verily, there was much hero-spirit in their worship! 

And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than 
by nailing men to the cross! 

As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their 
corpses; even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavour of 
charnel-houses. 

And he who liveth nigh unto them liveth nigh unto black 
pools, wherein the toad singeth his song with sweet gravity. 

Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in 
their Saviour: more like saved ones would his disciples have 
to appear unto me! 

Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should 
preach penitence. But whom would that disguised affliction 
convince! 

Verily, their saviours themselves came not from freedom 
and freedom s seventh heaven! Verily, they themselves never 
trod the carpets of knowledge! 

Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into 
every defect had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which 
they called God. 

In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they 
swelled and o erswelled with pity, there always floated to the 
surface a great folly. 

Eagerly arid with shouts drove they their flock over their 
foot-bridge; as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! 
Verily, those shepherds also were still of the flock! 

Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, 



THEVIRTUOUS 99 

my brethren, what small domains have even the most spacious 
souls hitherto been! 

Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and 
their folly taught that truth is proved by blood. 

But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood tainteth 
the purest teaching, and turneth it into delusion and hatred 
of heart. 

And when a person goeth through fire for his teaching 
what doth that prove! It is more, verily, when out of one s own 
burning cometh one s own teaching! 

Sultry heart and cold head; where these meet, there ariseth 
the blusterer, the "Saviour." 

Greater ones, verily, have there been, and higher-born ones, 
than those whom the people call saviours, those rapturous 
blusterers! 

And by still greater ones than any of the saviours must ye 
be saved, my brethren, if ye would find the way to freedom! 

Never yet hath there been a Superman. Naked have I seen 
both of them, the greatest man and the smallest man: 

All-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily, even the 
greatest found I all-too-human! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



27. The Virtuous 



WITH thunder and heavenly fireworks must one speak to in 
dolent and somnolent senses. 

But beauty s voice speaketh gently: it appealeth only to the 
most awakened souls. 



100 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Gently vibrated and laughed unto me to-day my buckler; it 
was beauty s holy laughing and thrilling. 

At you, ye virtuous ones, laughed my beauty to-day. And 
thus came its voice unto me: "They want to be paid besides!" 

Ye want to be paid besides, ye virtuous ones! Ye want re 
ward for virtue, and heaven for earth, and eternity for your to 
day? 

And now ye upbraid me for teaching that there is no reward- 
giver, nor paymaster? And verily, I do not even teach that 
virtue is its own reward. 

Ah! this is my sorrow: into the basis of things have reward 
and punishment been insinuated and now even into the 
basis of your souls, ye virtuous ones! 

But like the snout of the boar shall my word grub up the 
basis of your souls; a ploughshare will I be called by you. 

All the secrets of your heart shall be brought to light; and 
when ye lie in the sun, grubbed up and broken, then will also 
your falsehood be separated from your truth. 

For this is your truth: ye are too pure for the filth of the 
words: vengeance, punishment, recompense, retribution. 

Ye love your virtue as a mother loveth her child; but when 
did one hear of a mother wanting to be paid for her love? 

It is your dearest Self, your virtue. The ring s thirst is in 
you: to reach itself again struggleth every ring, and turneth 
itself. 

And like the star that goeth out, so is every work of your 
virtue: ever is its light on its way and travelling and when 
will it cease to be on its way? 

Thus is the light of your virtue still on its way, even when 
its work is done. Be it forgotten and dead, still its ray of light 
liveth and travelleth. 

That your virtue is your Self, and not an outward thing, a 



THE VIRTUOUS IOI 

skin, or a cloak : that is the truth from the basis of your souls, 
ye virtuous ones! 

But sure enough there are those to whom virtue meaneth 
writhing under the lash: and ye have hearkened too much unto 
their crying! 

And others are there who call virtue the slothfulness of 
their vices; and when once their hatred and jealousy relax the 
limbs, their "justice" becometh lively and rubbeth its sleepy 
eyes. 

And others are there who are drawn downwards: their 
devils draw them. But the more they sink, the more ardently 
gloweth their eye, and the longing for their God. 

Ah! their crying also hath reached your ears, ye virtuous 
ones: "What I am not, that, that is God to me, and virtue!" 

And others are there who go along heavily and creakingly, 
like carts taking stones downhill: they talk much of dignity 
and virtue their drag they call virtue! 

And others are there who are like eight-day clocks when 
wound up; they tick, and want people to call ticking virtue. 

Verily, in those have I mine amusement: wherever I find 
such clocks I shall wind them up with my mockery, and they 
shall even whirr thereby! 

And others are proud of their modicum of righteousness, 
and for the sake of it do violence to all things : so that the world 
is drowned in their unrighteousness. 

Ah! how ineptly cometh the word "virtue" out of their 
mouth! And when they say: "I am just," it always soundeth 
like: "I am just revenged!" 

With their virtues they want to scratch out the eyes of their 
enemies; and they elevate themselves only that they may lower 
others. 

And again there are those who sit in their swamp, and speak 



IO2 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

thus from among the bulrushes: "Virtue that is to sit quietly 
in the swamp. 

We bite no one, and go out of the way of him who would 
bite; and in all matters we have the opinion that is given us." 

And again there are those who love attitudes, and think that 
virtue is a sort of attitude. 

Their knees continually adore, and their hands are eulogies 
of virtue, but their heart knoweth naught thereof. 

And again there are those who regard it as virtue to say: 
"Virtue is necessary"; but after all they believe only that police 
men are necessary. 

And many a one who cannot see men s loftiness, calleth it 
virtue to see their baseness far too well: thus calleth he his 
evil eye virtue. 

And some want to be edified and raised up, and call it 
virtue: and others want to be cast down, and likewise call 
it virtue. 

And thus do almost all think that they participate in virtue; 
and at least every one claimeth to be an authority on "good" 
and "evil." 

But Zarathustra came not to say unto all those liars and 
fools: "What do ye know of virtue! What could ye know of 
virtue !"- 

But that ye, my friends, might become weary of the old 
words which ye have learned from the fools and liars: 

That ye might become weary of the words "reward," "retri- 
oution," "punishment," "righteous vengeance." 

That ye might become weary of saying: "That an action is 
good is because it is unselfish." 

Ah! my friends! That your very Self be in your action, as 
the mother is in the child: let that be your formula of virtue! 



THE R AB BLE 103 

Verily, I have taken from you a hundred formulae and youi 
virtue s favourite playthings; and now ye upbraid me, as 
children upbraid. 

They played by the sea then came there a wave and swept 
their playthings into the deep: and now do they cry. 

But the same wave shall bring them new playthings, and 
spread before them new speckled shells! 

Thus will they be comforted; and like them shall ye also, my 
friends, have your comforting and new speckled shells! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



s8. The Rabble 



LIFE is a well of delight; but where the rabble also drink, 
there all fountains are poisoned. 

To everything cleanly am I well disposed; but I hate to see 
the grinning mouths and the thirst of the unclean. 

They cast their eye down into the fountain: and now 
glanceth up to me their odious smile out of the fountain. 

The holy water have they poisoned with their lustfulness; 
and when they called their filthy dreams delight, then poisoned 
they also the words. 

Indignant becometh the flame when they put their damp 
hearts to the fire; the spirit itself bubbleth and smoketh when 
the rabble approach the fire. 

Mawkish and over-mellow becometh the fruit in their 
hands: unsteady, and withered at the top, Hoth their look make 
the fruit-tree. 



104 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

And many a one who hath turned away from life, hath only 
turned away from the rabble: he hated to share with them 
fountain, flame, and fruit. 

And many a one who hath gone into the wilderness and 
suffered thirst with beasts of prey, disliked only to sit at the 
cistern with filthy camel-drivers. 

And many a one who hath come along as a destroyer, and 
as a hailstorm to all cornfields, wanted merely to put his foot 
into the jaws of the rabble, and thus stop their throat. 

And it is not the mouthful which hath most choked me, to 
know that life itself requireth enmity and death and torture- 
crosses: 

But I asked once, and suffocated almost with my question: 
What? Is the rabble also necessary for life? 

Are poisoned fountains necessary, and stinking fires, and 
filthy dreams, and maggots in the bread of life? 

Not my hatred, but my loathing, gnawed hungrily at my life! 
Ah, ofttimes became I weary of spirit, when I found even the 
rabble spiritual! 

And on the rulers turned I my back, when I saw what they 
now call ruling: to traffic and bargain for power with the 
rabble! 

Amongst peoples of a strange language did I dwell, with 
stopped ears: so that the language of their trafficking might 
remain strange unto me, and their bargaining for power. 

And holding my nose, I went morosely through all yester 
days and todays: verily, badly smell all yesterdays and todays 
of the scribbling rabble! 

Like a cripple become deaf, and blind, and dumb thus 
have I lived long; that I might not live with the power-rabble, 
the scribe-rabble, and the pleasure-rabble. 

Toilsomely did my spirit mount stairs, and cautiously ; alms 



THE RABBLE 105 

of delight were its refreshment; on the staff did life creep 
along with the blind one. 

What hath happened unto me? How have I freed myself 
from loathing? Who hath rejuvenated mine eye? How have I 
flown to the height where no rabble any longer sit at the 
wetts? 

DiJ my loathing itself create for me wings and fountain- 
divining powers? Verily, to the loftiest height had I to fly, to 
find again the well of delight! 

Oh, I have found it, my brethren! Here on the loftiest height 
bubbleth up for me the well of delight! And there is a life at 
whose waters none of the rabble drink with me! 

Almost too violently dost thou flow for me, thou fountain 
of delight! And often emptiest thou the goblet again, in want 
ing to fill it! 

And yet must I learn to approach thee more modestly: far 
too violently doth my heart still flow towards thee: 

My heart on which my summer burneth, my short, hot, 
melancholy, over-happy summer: how my summer heart 
longeth for thy coolness! 

Past, the lingering distress of my spring! Past, the wicked 
ness of my snowflakes in June! Summer have I become entirely, 
and summer- noontide! 

A summer on the loftiest height, with cold fountains and 
blissful stillness: oh, come, my friends, that the stillness may 
become more blissful! 

For this is our height and our home: too high and steep do 
we here dwell for all uncleanly ones and their thirst. 

Cast but your pure eyes into the well of my delight, my 
friends! How could it become turbid thereby! It shall laugh 
back to you with its purity. 



106 THUS "SPAKE ZARATHUSTKA 

On the tree of the future build we our nest, eagles shall 
bring us lone ones food in their beaks! 

Verily, no food of which the impure could be fellow-par 
takers! Fire, would they think they devoured, and burn their 
mouths! 

Verily, no abodes do we here keep ready for the impure! An 
ice-cave to their bodies would our happiness be, and to their 
spirits! 

And as strong winds will we live above them, neighbours to 
the eagles, neighbours to the snow, neighbours to the sun : thus 
live the strong winds. 

And like a wind will I one day blow amongst them, and with 
my spirit, take the breath from their spirit: thus willeth my 
future. 

Verily, a strong wind is Zarathustra to all low places; and 
this counsel counselleth he to his enemies, and to whatever 
spitteth and speweth: "Take care not to spit against the 
wind!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



29. The Tarantulas 



Lo, THIS is the tarantula s den! Would st thou see the taran 
tula itself? Here hangeth its web: touch this, so that it may 
tremble. 

There cometh the tarantula willingly: Welcome, tarantula! 
Black on thy back is thy triangle and symbol; and I know also 
what is in thy soul. 



THE TARANTULAS 107 

Revenge is in thy soul: wherever thou bitest, there ariseth 
black scab; with revenge, thy poison maketh the soul giddy! 

Thus do I speak unto you in parable, ye who make the soul 
giddy, ye preachers of equality! Tarantulas are ye unto me, and 
secretly revengeful ones! 

But I will soon bring your hiding-places to the light: there 
fore do I laugh in your face my laughter of the height. 

llierefore do I tear at your web, that your rage may lure you 
out of your den of lies, and that your revenge may leap forth 
from behind your word "justice." 

Because, for man to be redeemed from revenge that is for 
me the bridge to the highest hope, and a rainbow after long 
storms. 

Otherwise, however, would the tarantulas have it. "Let it 
he very justice for the world to become full of the storms of 
our vengeance thus do they talk to one another. 

"Vengeance will we use, and insult, against all who are not 
like us" thus do the tarantula-hearts pledge themselves. 

"And Will to Equality that itself shall henceforth be the 
name of virtue; and against all that hath power will we raise 
an outcry!" 

Ye preachers of equality, the tyrant-frenzy of impotence 
crieth thus in you for "equality": your most secret tyrant- 
longings disguise themselves thus in virtue- words! 

Fretted conceit and suppressed envy perhaps your fathers 
conceit and envy: in you break they forth as flame and frenzy 
of vengeance. 

What the father hath hid cometh out in the son; and oft 
have I found in the son the father s revealed secret. 

Inspired ones they resemble: but it is not the heart that in- 
spireth them but vengeance. And when they become subtle 
and cold, it is not spirit, but envy, that maketh them so. 



108 THUS SPAKE ZARATHCJSTRA 

Their jealousy leadeth them also into thmkers* paths; and 
this is the sign of their jealousy they always go too far: so 
that their fatigue hath at last to go to sleep on the snow. 

In all their lamentations soundeth vengeance, in all their 
eulogies is maleficence; and being judge seemeth to them bliss. 

But thus do I counsel you, my friends: distrust all in whom 
the impulse to punish is powerful! 

They are people of bad race and lineage; out of their coun 
tenances peer the hangman and the sleuth-hound. 

Distrust all those who talk much of their justice! Verily, in 
their souls not only honey is lacking. 

And when they call themselves "the good and just," forget 
not, that for them to be Pharisees, nothing is lacking but 
power! 

My friends, I will not be mixed up and confounded with 
others. 

There are those who preach my doctrine of life, and are at 
the same time preachers of equality, and tarantulas. 

That they speak in favour of life, though they sit in their 
den, these poison-spiders, and withdrawn from life is be 
cause they would thereby do injury. 

To those would they thereby do injury who have power at 
present : for with those the preaching of death is still most at 
home. 

Were it otherwise, then would the tarantulas teach other 
wise: and they themselves were formerly the best world- 
maligners and heretic-burners. 

With these preachers of equality will I not be mixed up and 
confounded. For thus speaketh justice unto me: "Men are not 
equal." 

And neither shall they become so! What would be my love 
to the Superman, if I spake otherwise? 



THE TARANTULAS 109 

On a thousand bridges and piers shall they throng to the 
future, and always shall there be more war and inequality 
among them: thus doth my great love make me speak! 

Inventors of figures and phantoms shall they be in their 
hostilities; and with those figures and phantoms shall they yet 
fight with each other the supreme fight! 

Good and evil, and rich and poor, and high and low, and 
ail names of values : weapons shall they be, and sounding signs, 
that life must again and again surpass itself! 

Aloft will it build itself with columns and stairs life itself: 
into remote distances would it gaze, and out towards blissful 
beauties therefore doth it require elevation! 

And because it requireth elevation, therefore doth it re 
quire steps, and variance of steps and climbers! To rise striveth 
life, and in rising to surpass itself. 

And just behold, my friends! Here where the tarantula s den 
is, riseth aloft an ancient temple s ruins just behold it with 
enlightened eyes! 

Verily, he who here towered aloft his thoughts in stone, 
knew as well as the wisest nes about the secret of life! 

That there is struggle and inequality even in beauty, and 
war for power and supremacy: that doth he here teach us in 
the plainest parable. 

How divinely do vault and arch here contrast in the struggle : 
how with light and shade they strive against each other, the 
divinely striving ones. 

Thus, steadfast and beautiful, let us also be enemies, my 
friends! Divinely will we strive against one another! 

Alas! There hath the tarantula bit me myself, mine old 
enemy! Divinely steadfast and beautiful, it hath bit me on 
the finger! 

"Punishment must there be, and justice" so thinketh it: 



110 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

"not gratuitously shall he here sing songs in honour of 
enmity!" 

Yea, it hath revenged itself! An&lt;f alas! now will it make 
my soul also dizzy with revenge! 

That I may not turn dizzy, however, bind me fast, my 
friends, to this pillar! Rather will I be a pillar-saint than a 
whirl of vengeance! 

Verily, no cyclone or whirlwind is Zarathustra: and if he 
be a dancer, he is not at all a tarantula-dancer! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



jo. The Famous Wise Ones 



THE people have ye served and the people s superstition not 
the truth! all ye famous wise ones! And just on that account 
did they pay you reverence. 

And on that account also did they tolerate your unbelief, 
because it was a pleasantry and a by-path for the people. Thus 
doth the master give free scope to his slaves, and even en- 
joyeth their presumptuousness. 

But he who is hated by the people, as the wolf by the dogs 
is the free spirit, the enemy of fetters, the non-adorer, the 
dweller in the woods. 

To hunt him out of his lair that was always called "sense 
of right" by the people: on him do thev still hound their 
sharpest-toothed dogs. 

"For there the truth is, where the people are! Woe, woe to 
the seeking ones!" thus hath it echoed through all time. 



THE FAMOUS WISE ONES III 

Your people would ye justify in their reverence: that called 
ye "Will to Truth," ye famous wise ones! 

And your heart hath always said to itself: "From the people 
have I come: from thence carne to me also the voice of God." 

Stiff-necked and artful, like the ass, have ye always been, as 
the advocates of the people. 

And many a powerful one who wanted to run well with the 
people, hath harnessed in front of his horses a donkey, a 
famous wise man. 

And now, ye famous wise ones, I would have you finally 
throw off entirely the skin of the lion! 

The skin of the beast of prey, the speckled skin, and the 
dishevelled locks of the investigator, the searcher, and the con 
queror! 

Ah! for me to learn to believe in your "conscientiousness," 
ye would first have to break your venerating will. 

Conscientious so call I him who goeth into God-forsaken 
wildernesses, and hath broken his venerating heart. 

In the yellow sands and burnt by the sun, he doubtless 
peereth thirstily at the isles rich in fountains, where life re- 
poseth under shady trees. 

But his thirst doth not persuade him to become like those 
comfortable ones: for where there are oases, there are also 
idols. 

Hungry, fierce, lonesome, God-forsaken: so doth the lion- 
will wish itself. 

Free from the happiness of slaves, redeemed from deities 
and adorations, fearless and fear- inspiring, grand and lone 
some: so is the will of the conscientious. 

In the wilderness have ever dwelt the conscientious, the 
free spirits, v* lords of the wilderness; but in the cities dwell 
the well-foddered, famous wise ones the draught-beasts. 



112 ~THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

For, always do they draw, as asses the people s carts! 

Not that I on that account upbraid them: but serving ones 
do they remain, and harnessed ones, even though they glitter 
in golden harness. 

And often have they been good servants and worthy of their 
hire. For thus saith virtue: "If thou must be a servant, seek 
him unto whom thy service is most useful! 

The spirit and virtue of thy master shall advance by thou 
being his servant: thus wilt thou thyself advance with his 
spirit and virtue!" 

And verily, ye famous wise ones, ye servants of the people! 
Ye yourselves have advanced with the people s spirit and vir 
tue and the people by you! To your honour do I say it! 

But the people ye remain for me, even with your virtues, 
the people with purblind eyes the people who know not what 
spirit is! 

Spirit is life which itself cutteth into life: by its own torture 
doth it increase its own knowledge, did ye know that before? 

And the spirit s happiness is this: to be anointed and conse 
crated with tears as a sacrificial victim, did ye know that be 
fore? 

And the blindness of the blind one, and his seeking and 
groping, shall yet testify to the power of the sun into which 
he hath gazed, did ye know that before? 

And with mountains shall the discerning one learn to build! 
It is a small thing for the spirit to remove mountains, did ye 
know that before? 

Ye know only the sparks of the spirit: but ye do not see the 
anvil which it is, and the cruelty of its hammer! 

Verily, ye know not the spirit s pride! But still less could 
ye endure the spirit s humility, should it ever want to speak! 

And never yet could ye cast your spirit into a pit of snow: 



THE NIGHT-SONG 113 

ye are not hot enough for that! Thus are ye unaware, also, of 
the delight of its coldness. 

In all respects, however, ye make too familiar with the spirit; 
and out of wisdom have ye often made an alms-house and a 
hospital for bad poets. 

Ye are not eagles : thus have ye never experienced the happi 
ness of the alarm of the spirit. And he who is not a bird should 
not camp above abysses. 

Ye seem to me lukewarm ones : but coldly floweth all deep 
knowledge. Ice-cold are the innermost wells of the spirit: a 
refreshment to hot hands and handlers. 

Respectable do ye there stand, and stiff, and with straight 
backs, ye famous wise ones! no strong wind or will im- 
pelleth you. 

Have ye ne er seen a sail crossing the sea, rounded and in- 
flated, and trembling with the violence of the wind? 

Like the sail trembling with the violence of the spirit, doth 
my wisdom cross the sea my wild wisdom! 

But ye servants of the people, ye famous wise ones how 
could ye go with me! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



. The Night-Song 



Tis night: now do all gushing fountains speak louder. And 
my soul also is a gushing fountain. 

Tis night: now only do all songs of the loving ones awake. 
And my soul also is the song of a loving one. 

Something unappeased, unappeasable, is within me; if 



114 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

longeth ;o find expression. A craving for love is within me. 
which speaketh itself the language of love. 

Light am I: ah, that I were night! But it is my lonesomeness 
to be begirt with light! 

Ah, that I were dark and nightly! How would I suck at tne 
breasts of light! 

And you yourselves would I bless, ye twinkling starlets and 
glow-worms aloft! and would rejoice in the gifts of your 
light. 

But I live in mine own light, I drink again into myself the 
flames that break forth from me. 

I know not the happiness of the receiver; and oft have I 
dreamt that stealing must be more blessed than receiving. 

It is my poverty that my hand never ceaseth bestowing; it is 
mine envy that I see waiting eyes and the brightened nights of 
longing. 

Oh, the misery of all bestowers! Oh, the darkening of my 
sun! Oh, the craving to crave! Oh, the violent hunger in satiety! 

They take from me: but do I yet touch their soul? There is a 
gap twixt giving and receiving; and the smallest gap hath 
finally to be bridged over. 

A hunger ariseth out of my beauty: I should like to injure 
those I illumine; I should like to rob those I have gifted: 
thus do I hunger for wickedness. 

Withdrawing my hand when another hand already 
stretcheth out to it; hesitating like the cascade, which hesi- 
tateth even in its leap: thus do I hunger for wickedness! 

Such revenge doth mine abundance think of: such mischief 
welleth out of my lonesomeness. 

My happiness in bestowing died in bestowing; my virtue 
became weary of itself by its abundance! 

He who ever bestoweth is in danger of losing his shame; to 



THE NIGHT-SONG 115 

him who ever dispenseth, the hand and heart become callous 
by very dispensing. 

Mine eye no longer overflowed! for the shame of suppliants; 
my hand hath become too hard for the trembling of rilled 
hands. 

Whence have gone the tears of mine eye, and the down of 
my heart? Oh, the lonesomeness of all bestowers! Oh, the 
silence of all shining ones! 

Many suns circle in desert space: to all that is dark do they 
speak with their light but to me they are silent. 

Oh, this is the hostility of light to the shining one: un- 
pityingly doth it pursue its course. 

Unfair to the shining one in its innermost heart, cold to the 
suns: thus travelleth every sun. 

Like a storm do the suns pursue their courses : that is theii 
travelling. Their inexorable will do they follow: that is their 
coldness. 

Oh, ye only is it, ye dark, nightly ones, that extract warmth 
from the shining ones! Oh, ye only drink milk and refreshment 
from the light s udders! 

Ah, there is ice around me; my hand burneth with the 
iciness! Ah, there is thirst in me; it panteth after your thirst! 

Tis night: alas, that I have to be light! And thirst for the 
nightly! And lonesomeness! 

Tis night: now doth my longing break forth in me as a 
fountain, for speech do I long. 

Tis night : now do all gushing fountains speak louder. And 
my soul also is a gushing fountain. 

Tis night: now do all songs of loving ones awake. And 
my soul also is the song of a loving one. 

Thus sang Zarathustra.

32. The Dance-Song 



ONE evening went Zarathustra and his disciples through the 
forest; and when he sought for a well, lo, he lighted upon a 
green meadow peacefully surrounded by trees and bushes 
where maidens were dancing together. As soon as the maidens 
recognised Zarathustra, they ceased dancing; Zarathustra, how 
ever, approached them with friendly mien and spake these 
words : 

Cease not your dancing, ye lovely maidens! No game-spoiler 
hath come to you with evil eye, no enemy of maidens. 

God s advocate am I with the devil: he, however, is the 
spirit of gravity. How could I, ye light-footed ones, be hostile 
to divine dances? Or to maidens feet with fine ankles? 

To be sure, I am a forest, and a night of dark trees : but he 
who is not afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses 
under my cypresses. 

And even the little God may he find, who is dearest to 
maidens: beside the well lieth he quietly, with closed eyes. 

Verily, in broad daylight did he fall asleep, the sluggard! 
Had he perhaps chased butterflies too much? 

Upbraid me not, ye beautiful dancers, when I chasten the 
little God somewhat! He will cry, certainly, and weep but 
he is laughable even when weeping! 

And with tears in his eyes shall he ask you for a dance; and 
I myself will sing a song to his dance: 

A dance-song and satire on the spirit of gravity my su- 
premest powerfulest devil, who is said to be "lord of the 
world." 



THE DANCE-SONG 

And this is the song that Zarathustra sang when Cupid and 
the maidens danced together: 

Of late did I gaze into thine eye, O Life! And into the un 
fathomable did I there seem to sink. 

But thou pulledst me out with a golden angle; derisively 
didst thou laugh when I called thee unfathomable. 

"Such is the language of all fish," saidst thou; "what they 
do not fathom is unfathomable. 

But changeable am I only, and wild, and altogether a 
woman, and no virtuous one: 

Though I be called by you men the profound one, or the 
faithful one, the eternal one, the mysterious one/ 

But ye men endow us always with your own virtues alas, 
ye virtuous ones!" 

Thus did she laugh, the unbelievable one; but never do I be 
lieve her and her laughter, when she speaktth evil of herself. 

And when I talked face to face with my wild Wisdom, she 
said to me angrily: "Thou wiliest, thou cravest, thou lovest; 
on that account alone dost thou praise Life!" 

Then had I almost answered indignantly and told the truth 
to the angry one; and one cannot answer more indignantly 
than when one "telleth the truth" to one s Wisdom. 

For thus do things stand with us three. In my heart do I love 
only Life and verily, most when I hate her! 

But that I am fond of Wisdom, and often too fond, is be 
cause she remindeth me very strongly of Life! 

She hath her eye, her laugh, and even her golden angle-rod: 
am I responsible for it that both are so alike? 

And when once Life asked me: "Who is she then, this Wis 
dom?" then said I eagerly: "Ah, yes! Wisdom! 



Il8 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

One thirsteth for her and is not satisfied, one looketh 
through veils, one graspeth through nets. 

Is she beautiful? What do I know! But the oldest carps are 
still lured by her. 

Changeable is she, and wayward; often have I seen her bite 
her lip, and pass the comb against the grain of her hair. 

Perhaps she is wicked and false, and altogether a woman; 
but when she speaketh ill of herself, just then doth she seduce 
most." 

When I had said this unto Life, then laughed she mali 
ciously, and shut her eyes. Of whom dost thou speak?" said 
she. "Perhaps of me? 

And if thou wert right is it proper to say that in such wise 
to my face! But now, pray, speak also of thy Wisdom!" 

Ah, and now hast thou again opened thine eyes, O beloved 
Life! And into the unfathomable have I again seemed to 
sink. 

Thus sang Zarathustra. But when the dance was over and 
the maidens had departed, he became sad. 

"The sun hath been long set," said he at last, "the meadow 
is damp, and from the forest cometh coolness. 

An unknown presence is about me, and gazeth thoughtfully. 
What! Thou livest still, Zarathustra? 

Why? Wherefore? Whereby? Whither? Where? How? Is 
it not folly still to live? 

Ah, my friends; the evening is it which thus interrogated! in 
me. Forgive me my sadness! 

Evening hath come on: forgive me that evening hath come 
on!" 

Thus sang Zarathustra. 



THE GRAVE-SONG 119 

. The Grave-Song 



"YONDER is the grave-island, the silent isle; yonder also are 
the graves of my youth. Thither will I carry an evergreen 
wreath of life." 

Resolving thus in my heart, did I sail o er the sea. 

Oh, ye sights and scenes of my youth! Oh, all ye gleams of 
love, ye divine fleeting gleams! How could ye perish so soon 
for me! I think of you to-day as my dead ones. 

From you, my dearest dead ones, cometh unto me a sweet 
savour, heart-opening and melting. Verily, it convulseth and 
openeth the heart of the lone seafarer. 

Still am I the richest and most to be envied I, the lone- 
somest one! For I have possessed you, and ye possess me still. 
Tell me: to whom hath there ever fallen such rosy apples from 
the tree as have fallen unto me? 

Still am I your love s heir and heritage, blooming to your 
memory with many-hued, wild-growing virtues, O ye dearest 
ones! 

Ah, we were made to remain nigh unto each other, ye 
kindly strange marvels; and not like timid birds did ye come 
to me and my longing nay, but as trusting ones to a trusting 
one! 

Yea, made for faithfulness, like me, and for fond eternities, 
must I now name you by your faithlessness, ye divine glances 
and fleeting gleams : no other name have I yet learnt 

Verily, too early did ye die for me, ye fugitives. Yet did ye 
not flee from me, nor did I flee from you; innocent are we tc 
each other in our faithlessness. 

To kill me, did they strangle you, ye singing birds of my 



120 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

hopes! Yea, at you, ye dearest ones, did malice ever shoot its 
arrows to hit my heart! 

And they hit it! Because ye were always my dearest, my 
possession and my possessedness: on that account had ye to die 
young, and far too early! 

At my most vulnerable point did they shoot the arrow 
namely, at you, whose skin is like down or more like the 
smile that dieth at a glance! 

But this word will I say unto mine enemies: What is all man 
slaughter in comparison with what ye have done unto me! 

Worse evil did ye do unto me than all manslaughter; the 
irretrievable did ye take from me: thus do I speak unto you 
mine enemies! 

Slew ye not my youth s visions and dearest marvels! My 
playmates took ye from me, the blessed spirits! To their 
memory do I deposit this wreath and this curse. 

This curse upon you, mine enemies! Have ye not made mine 
eternal short, as a tone dieth away in a cold night! Scarcely, as 
the twinkle of divine eyes, did it come to me as a fleeting 
gleam! : 

Thus spake once in a happy hour my purity: "Divine shall 
everything be unto me." 

Then did ye haunt me with foul phantoms; ah, whither 
hath that happy hour now fled! 

"All days shall be holy unto me" so spake once the wis 
dom of my youth: verily, the language of a joyous wisdom! 

But then did ye enemies steal my nights, and sold them to 
sleepless torture: ah, whither hath that joyous wisdom now 
fled? 

Once did I long for happy auspices : then did ye lead an owl- 
monster across my path, an adverse sign. Ah, whither did my 
tender longing then flee? 



THE GRAVE-SONG 121 

All loathing did I once vow to renounce: then did ye change 
my nigh ones and nearest ones into ulcerations. Ah, whither 
did my noblest vow then flee? 

As a blind one did I once walk in blessed ways: then did ye 
cast filth on the blind one s course: and now is he disgusted 
with the old footpath. 

And when I performed my hardest task, and celebrated the 
triumph of my victories, then did ye make those who loved me 
call out that I then grieved them most. 

Verily, it was always your doing: ye embittered to me my 
best honey, and the diligence of my best bees. 

To my charity have ye ever sent the most impudent beggars; 
around my sympathy have ye ever crowded the incurably 
shameless. Thus have ye wounded the faith of my virtue. 

And when I offered my holiest as a sacrifice, immediately 
did your "piety" put its fatter gifts beside it: so that my holiest 
suffocated in the fumes of your fat. 

And once did I want to dance as I had never yet danced : be 
yond all heavens did I want to dance. Then did ye seduce my 
favourite minstrel. 

And now hath he struck up an awful, melancholy air; alas, 
he tooted as a mournful horn to mine ear! 

Murderous minstrel, instrument of evil, most innocent in 
strument! Already did I stand prepared for the best dance: then 
didst thou slay my rapture with thy tones! 

Only in the dance do I know how to speak the parable of 
the highest things: and now hath my grandest parable re 
mained unspoken in my limbs! 

Unspoken and unrealised hath my highest hope remained! 
And there have perished for me all the visions and consolations 
of my youth! 



122 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

How did I ever bear it? How did I survive and surmount 
such wounds? How did my soul rise again out of those sepul 
chres? 

Yea, something invulnerable, unburiable is with me, some 
thing that would rend rocks asunder: it is called my Will. 
Silently doth it proceed, and unchanged throughout the years. 

Its course will it go upon my feet, mine old Will; hard of 
heart is its nature and invulnerable. 

Invulnerable am I only in my heel. Ever livest thou there, 
and art like thyself, thou most patient one! Ever hast thou 
burst all shackles of the tomb! 

In thee still liveth also the unrealisedness of my youth; and 
as life and youth sittest thou here hopeful on the yellow ruins 
of graves. 

Yea, thou art still for me the demolisher of all graves : Hail 
to thee, my Will! And only where there are graves are there 
resurrections. 

Thus sang Zarathustra. 



. Self-Surpassing 



"WiLL to Truth" do ye call it, ye wisest ones, that which im- 
pelleth you and maketh you ardent? 

Will for the thinkableness of all being: thus do I call your 
will! 

All being would ye make thinkable: for ye doubt with good 
reason whether it be already thinkable. 

But it shall accommodate and bend itself to you! So willetb 



SELF-SURPASSING 12 3 

your will. Smooth shall it become and subject to the spirit, as 
its mirror and reflection. 

That is your entire will, ye wisest ones, as a Will to Power; 
and even when ye speak of good and evil, and of estimates of 
value. 

Ye would still create a world before which ye can bow the 
knee: such is your ultimate hope and ecstasy. 

The ignorant, to be sure, the people they are like a river 
on which a boat floateth along: and in the boat sit the estimates 
of value, solemn and disguised. 

Your will and your valuations have ye put on the river of 
becoming; it betrayeth unto me an old Will to Power, what is 
believed by the people as good and evil. 

It was ye, ye wisest ones, who put such guests in this boat, 
and gave them pomp and proud names ye and your ruling 
Will! 

Onward the river now carrieth your boat: it must carry it. A 
small matter if the rough wave f oameth and angrily resisteth 
its keel! 

It is not the river that is your danger and the end of your 
good and evil, ye wisest ones: but that Will itself, the Will to 
Power the unexhausted, procreating life-will. 

But that ye may understand my gospel of good and evil, for 
that purpose will I tell you my gospel of life, and of the nature 
of all living things. 

The living thing did I follow; I walked in the broadest and 
narrowest paths to lea rn its nature. 

With a hundred-faced mirror did I catch its glance when its 
mouth was shut, so that its eye might speak unto me. And its 
eye spake unto me. 

But wherever I found living things, there heard I also the 
language of obedience. All living things are obeying things. 



124 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

And this heard I secondly: Whatever cannot obey itself, is 
commanded. Such is the nature of living things. 

This, however, is the third thing which I heard namely, 
that commanding is more difficult than obeying. And not only 
because the commander beareth the burden of all obeyers, and 
because this burden readily crusheth him: 

An attempt and a risk seemed all commanding unto me; and 
whenever it commandeth, the living thing risketh itself there- 
by. 

Yea, even when it commandeth itself, then also must it 
atone for its commanding. Of its own law must it become the 
judge and avenger and victim. 

How doth this happen! So did I ask myself. What persuadeth 
the living thing to obey, and command, and even be obedient in 
commanding? 

Hearken now unto my word, ye wisest ones! Test it seri 
ously, whether I have crept into the heart of life itself, and into 
the roots of its heart! 

Wherever I found a living thing, there found I Will to 
Power; and even in the will of the servant found I the will to 
be master. 

That to the stronger the weaker shall serve thereto per 
suadeth he his will who would be master over a still weaker 
one. That delight alone he is unwilling to forego. 

And as the lesser surrendereth himself to the greater that 
he may have delight and power over the least of all, so doth 
even the greatest surrender himself, and staketh life, for the 
sake of power. 

It is the surrender of the greatest to run risk and danger, 
and play dice for death. 

And where there is sacrifice and service and love-glances, 
there also is the will to be master. By by-ways doth the weaker 



SELF-SURPASSING 125 

then slink into the fortress, and into the heart of the mightier 
one and there stealeth power. 

And this secret spake Life herself unto me. "Behold," said 
she, "I am that which must ever surpass itself. 

To be sure, ye call it will to procreation, or impulse towards 
a goal, towards the higher, remoter, more manifold: but all 
that is one and the same secret. 

Rather would I succumb than disown this one thing; and 
verily, where there is succumbing and leaf-falling, lo, there 
doth Life sacrifice itself for power! 

That I have to be struggle, and becoming, and purpose, and 
cross-purpose ah, he who divineth my will, divineth well also 
on what crooked paths it hath to tread! 

Whatever I create, and however much I love it, soon must 
I be adverse to it, and to my love: so willeth my will. 

And even thou, discerning one, art only a path and foot 
step of my will : verily, my Will to Power walketh even on the 
feet of thy Will to Truth! 

He certainly did not hit the truth who shot at it the 
formula: "Will to existence": that will doth not exist! 

For what is not, cannot will; that, however, which is in 
existence how could it still strive for existence! 

Only where there is life, is there also will: not, however, 
Will to Life, but so teach I thee Will to Power! 

Much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one; 
but out of the very reckoning speaketh the Will to 
Power !"- 

Thus did Life once teach me: and thereby, ye wisest ones, 
do I solve you the riddle of your hearts. 

Verily, I say unto you: good and evil which would be ever 
lastingit doth not exist! Of its own accord must it evet 
surpass itself anew. 



126 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

With your values and formulae of good and evil, ye exercise 
power, ye valuing ones: and that is your secret love, and the 
sparkling, trembling, and overflowing of your souls. 

But a stronger power groweth out of your values, and a new 
surpassing: by it breaketh egg and egg-shell. 

And he who hath to be a creator in good and evil verily, 
he hath first to be a destroyer, and break values in pieces. 

Thus doth the greatest evil pertain to the greatest good: 
that, however, is the creating good. 

Let us speak thereof, ye wisest ones, even though it be bad. 
To be silent is worse; all suppressed truths become poisonous. 

And let everything break up which can break up by our 
truths! Many a house is still to be built! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



. The Sublime Ones 



CALM is the bottom of my sea: who would guess that it hideth 
droll monsters! 

Unmoved is my depth: but it sparkleth with swimming 
enigmas and laughters. 

A sublime one saw I today, a solemn one, a penitent of the 
spirit: Oh, how my soul laughed at his ugliness! 

With upraised breast, and like those who draw in their 
breath: thus did he stand, the sublime one, and in silence: 

O erhung with ugly truths, the spoil of his hunting, and 
rich in torn raiment; many thorns also hung on him but I 
saw no rose. 



THE SUBLIME ONES 127 

Not yet had he learned laughing and beauty. Gloomy did 
this hunter return from the forest of knowledge. 

From the fight with wild beasts returned he home: but even 
yet a wild beast gazeth out of his seriousness an unconquered 
wild beast! 

As a tiger doth he ever stand, on the point of springing; but 
I do not like those strained souls; ungracious is my taste to 
wards all those self -engrossed ones. 

And ye tell me, friends, that there is to be no dispute about 
taste and tasting? But all life is a dispute about taste and 
tasting! 

Taste: that is weight at the same time, and scales and 
weigher; and alas for every living thing that would live with 
out dispute about weight and scales and weigher! 

Should he become weary of his sublimeness, this sublime 
one, then only will his beauty begin and then only will I taste 
him and find him savoury. 

And only when he turneth away from himself will he 
o erleap his own shadow and verily! into his sun. 

Far too long did he sit in the shade; the cheeks of the peni 
tent of the spirit became pale; he almost starved on his expec 
tations. 

Contempt is still in his eye, and loathing hideth in his 
mouth. To be sure, he now resteth, but he hath not yet taken 
rest in the sunshine. 

As the ox ought he to do; and his happiness should smell of 
the earth, and not of contempt for the earth , 

As a white ox would I like to see him, which, snorting and 
lowing, walketh before the plough-share: and his lowing 
should also laud all that is earthly! 

Dark is still his countenance; the shadow of his hand danceth 
upon it. O ershadowed is still the sense of his eye. 



128 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

His deed itself is still the shadow upon him: his doing 
obscureth the doer. Not yet hath he overcome his deed. 

To be sure, I love in him the shoulders of the ox : but now 
do I want to see also the eye of the angel. 

Also his hero- will hath he still to unlearn: an exalted one 
shall he be, and not only a sublime one: the ether itself 
should raise him, the will-less one! 

He hath subdued monsters, he hath solved enigmas. But 
he should also redeem his monsters and enigmas; into heavenly 
children should he transform them. 

As yet hath his knowledge not learned to smile, and to be 
without jealousy; as yet hath his gushing passion not become 
calm in beauty. 

Verily, not in satiety shall his longing cease and disappear, 
but in beauty! Gracefulness belongeth to the munificence of 
the magnanimous. 

His arm across his head : thus should the hero repose; thus 
should he also surmount his repose. 

But precisely to the hero is beauty the hardest thing of all. 
Unattainable is beauty by all ardent wills. 

A little more, a little less : precisely this is much here, it is 
the most here. 

To stand with relaxed muscles and with unharnessed will: 
that is the hardest for all of you, ye sublime ones! 

When power becometh gracious and descendeth into the 
visible I call such condescension, beauty. 

And from no one do I want beauty so much as from thee, 
thou powerful one: let thy goodness be thy last self -conquest. 

All evil do I accredit to thee: therefore do I desire of thee the 
good. 

Verily, ! have often laughed at the weaklings, who think 
themselves good because they have crippled paws! 



THE LAND OF CULTURE 129 

The virtue of the pillar shalt thou strive after: more beauti 
ful doth it ever become, and more graceful but internally 
harder and more sustaining the higher it riseth. 

Yea, thou sublime one, one day shalt thou also be beautiful, 
and hold up the mirror to thine own beauty. 

Then will thy soul thrill with divine desires; and there will 
be adoration even in thy vanity! 

For this is the secret of the soul : when the hero hath aban 
doned it, then only approacheth it in dreams the super 
hero. 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



36. The Land of Culture 

Too far did I fiy into the future: a horror seized upon me. 

And when I looked around me, lo! there time was my sole 
contemporary. 

Then did I fly backwards, homewards and always faster. 
Thus did I come unto you: ye present-day men, and into the 
land of culture. 

For the first time brought I an eye to see you, and good de 
sire: verily, with longing in my heart did I come. 

But how did it turn out with me? Although so alarmed I 
had yet to laugh! Never did mine eye see anything so motley- 
coloured! 

I laughed and laughed, while my foot stil" trembled, and 
my heart as well. "Here forsooth, is the home of all the paint- 
pots," said I. 



130 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

With fifty patches painted on faces and limbs so sat ye 
there to mine astonishment, ye present-day men! 

And with fifty mirrors around you, which flattered your play 
of colours, and repeated it! 

Verily, ye could wear no better masks, ye present-day men, 
than your own faces! Who could recognise you! 

Written all over with the characters of the past, and these 
characters also pencilled over with new characters thus have 
ye concealed yourselves well from all decipherers! 

And though one be a trier of the reins, who still believeth 
that ye have reins! Out of colours ye seem to be baked, and out 
of glued scraps. 

All times and peoples gaze divers-coloured out of your veils; 
all customs and beliefs speak divers-coloured out of your ges 
tures. 

He who would strip you of veils and wrappers, and paints 
and gestures, would just have enough left to scare the crows. 

Verily, I myself am the scared crow that once saw you naked, 
and without paint; and I flew away when the skeleton ogled at 
me. 

Rather would I be a day-labourer in the nether-world, and 
among the shades of the by-gone! Fatter and fuller than ye, 
are forsooth the nether- worldlings! 

This, yea this, is bitterness to my bowels, that I can neither 
endure you naked nor clothed, ye present-day men! 

All that is unhomelike in the future, and whatever maketh 
strayed birds shiver, is verily more homelike and familiar than 
your "reality." 

For thus speak ye: "Real are we wholly, and without faith 
and superstition": thus do ye plume yourselves alas! even 
without plumes! 

Indeed, how would ye be able to believe, ye divers-coloured 



THE LAND OF CULTURE 131 

ones! ye who are pictures of all that hath ever been believed! 

Perambulating refutations are ye, of belief itself, and a dis 
location of all thought. Untrustworthy ones: thus do I call you, 
ye real ones! 

All periods prate against one another in your spirits; and 
the dreams and pratings of all periods were even realer than 
your awakeness! 

Unfruitful are ye: therefore do ye lack belief. But he who 
had to create, had always his presaging dreams and astral 
premonitions and believed in believing! 

Half-open doors are ye, at which grave-diggers wait. And 
this is your reality: "Everything deserveth to perish." 

Alas, how ye stand there before me, ye unfruitful ones; how 
lean your ribs! And many of you surely have had knowledge 
thereof. 

Many a one hath said: "There hath surely a God niched 
something from me secretly whilst I slept? Verily, enough to 
make a girl for himself therefrom! 

"Amazing is the poverty of my ribs!" thus hath spoken many 
a present-day man. 

Yea, ye are laughable unto me, ye present-day men! And 
especially when ye marvel at yourselves! 

And woe unto me if I could not laugh at your marvelling, 
and had to swallow all that is repugnant in your platters! 

As it is, however, I will make lighter of you, since I have to 
carry what is heavy; and what matter if beetles and May-bugs 
also alight on my load ! 

Verily, it shall not on that account become heavier to me! 
Ana not from you, ye present-day men, shall my grear weari 
ness arise. 

Ah, whither shall I now ascend with my longing! From all 
mountains do I look out for fatherlands and motherlands. 



132 THUS SPAKt ZARATHUSTRA 

But a home have I found nowhere: unsettled am I in all 
cities, and decamping at all gates. 

Alien to me, and a mockery, are the present-day men, to 
whom of late my heart impelled me; and exiled am I from 
fatherlands and motherlands. 

Thus do I love only my children s land, the undiscovered in 
the remotest sea: for it do I bid my sails search and search. 

Unto my children will I make amends for being the child of 
my fathers: and unto all the future for this present-day! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



. Immaculate Perception 



WHEN yester-eve the moon arose, then did I fancy it about to 
bear a sun: so broad and teeming did it lie on the horizon. 

But it was a liar with its pregnancy; and sooner will I believe 
in the man in the moon than in the woman. 

To be sure, little of a man is he also, that timid night- 
reveller. Verily, with a bad conscience doth he stalk over the 
roofs. 

For he is covetous and jealous, the monk in the moon; 
covetous of the earth, and all the joys of lovers. 

Nay, I like him not, that tom-cat on the roofs! Hateful unto 
me are all that slink around half -closed windows! 

Piously and silently doth he stalk along on the star-carpets: 
but I like no light-treading human feet, on which not even 
a spur jingleth. 

Every honest one s step speaketh; the cat however, steal eth 



IMMACULATE PERCEPTION 133 

along over the ground. Lo! cat-like doth the moon come along, 
and dishonestly. 

This parable speak I unto you sentimental dissemblers, unto 
you, the "pure discerners!" You do / call covetous ones! 

Also ye love the earth, and the earthly : I have divined you 
well! but shame is in your love, and a bad conscience ye are 
like the moon! 

To despise the earthly hath your spirit been persuaded, but 
not your bowels: these, however, are the strongest in you! 

And now is your spirit ashamed to be at the service of your 
bowels, and goeth in by-ways and lying ways to escape its own 
shame. 

"That would be the highest thing for me"- -so saith your 
lying spirit unto itself "to gaze upon life without desire, and 
not like the dog, with hanging-out tongue: 

To be happy in gazing: with dead will, free from the grip 
and greed of selfishness cold and ashy-grey all over, but with 
intoxicated moon-eyes! 

That would be the dearest thing to me thus doth the se 
duced one seduce himself, "to love the earth as the moon 
loveth it, and with the eye only to feel its beauty. 

And this do I call immaculate perception of all things: to 
want nothing else from them, but to be allowed to lie before 
them as a mirror with a hundred facets." 

Oh, ye sentimental dissemblers, ye covetous ones! Ye lack 
innocence in your desire: and now do ye defame desiring on 
that account! 

Verily, not as creators, as procreators, or as jubilators do ye 
love the earth! 

Where is innocence? Where there is will to procreation. 
And he who seeketh to create beyond himself, hath for me the 
purest will. 



134 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Where is beauty? Where I must will with my whole Will; 
where I will love and perish, that an image may not remain 
merely an image. 

Loving and perishing: these have rhymed from eternity. 
Will to love: that is to be ready also for death. Thus do I speak 
unto you cowards! 

But now doth your emasculated ogling profess to be "con 
templation!" And that which can be examined with cowardly 
eyes is to be christened "beautiful!" Oh, ye violators of noble 
names! 

But it shall be your curse, ye immaculate ones, ye pure dis- 
cerners, that ye shall never bring forth, even though ye lie 
broad and teeming on the horizon! 

Verily, ye fill your mouth with noble words : and we are to 
believe that your heart overflowed^, ye cozeners? 

But my words are poor, contemptible, stammering words: 
gladly do I pick up what falleth from the table at your repasts. 

Yet still can I say therewith the truth to dissemblers! Yea, 
my fish-bones, shells, and prickly leaves shall tickle the noses 
of dissemblers! 

Bad air is always about you and your repasts : your lascivious 
thoughts, your lies, and secrets are indeed in the air! 

Dare only to believe in yourselves in yourselves and in 
your inward parts! He who doth not believe in himself always 
lieth. 

A God s mask have ye hung in front of you, ye "pure ones" : 
into a God s mask hath your execrable coiling snake crawled. 

Verily ye deceive, ye "contemplative ones!" Even Zarathus- 
tra was once the dupe of your godlike exterior; he did not 
divine the serpent s coil with which it was stuffed. 

A God s soul, I once thought I saw playing in your games, 



SCHOLARS 135 

ye pure discerners! No better arts did I once dream of than your 
arts! 

Serpents filth and evil odour, the distance concealed from 
me: and that a lizard s craft prowled thereabouts lasciviously. 

But I came nigh unto you : then came to me the day, and 
now cometh it to you, at an end is the moon s love affair! 

See there! Surprised and pale doth it stand before the 
rosy dawn! 

For already she cometh, the glowing one, her love to the 
earth cometh! Innocence, and creative desire, is all solar love! 

See there, how she cometh impatiently over the sea! Do ye 
not feel the thirst and the hot breath of her love? 

At the sea would she suck, and drink its depths to her height: 
now riseth the desire of the sea with its thousand breasts. 

Kissed and sucked would it be by the thirst of the sun; 
vapour would it become, and height, and path of light, and 
light itself! 

Verily, like the sun do I love life, and all deep seas. 

And this meaneth to me knowledge: all that is deep shall 
ascend to my height! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



38. Scholars 



WHEN I lay asleep, then did a sheep eat at the ivy-wreath on 
my head, it ate, and said thereby: "Zarathustra is no longer a 
scholar." 

It said this, and \ver/t away clumsily and proudly. A chile? 
told it to int. 



136 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

I like to lie here where the children play, beside the ruiaed 
wall, among thistles and red poppies. 

A scholar am I still to the children, and also to the thistles 
?ind red poppies. Innocent are they, even in their wickedness. 

But to the sheep I am no longer a scholar; so willeth my lot 
-blessings upon it! 

For this is the truth: I have departed from the house of 
the scholars, and the door have I also slammed behind me. 

Too long did my soul sit hungry at their table: not like them 
have I got the knack of investigating, as the knack of nut- 
cracking. 

Freedom do I love, and the air over fresh soil; rather would 
I sleep on ox-skins than on their honours and dignities. 

I am too hot and scorched with mine own thought : often is 
it ready to take away my breath. Then have I to go into the 
open air, and away from all dusty rooms. 

But they sit cool in the cool shade: they want in everything 
\;o be merely spectators, and they avoid sitting where the sun 
burneth on the steps. 

Like those who stand in the street and gape at the passers-by: 
thus do they also wait, and gape at the thoughts which others 
have thought. 

Should one lay hold of them, then do they raise a dust like 
flour-sacks, and involuntarily: but who would divine that their 
dust came from corn, and from the yellow delight of the sum 
mer fields? 

When they give themselves out as wise, then do their petty 
sayings and truths chill me: in their wisdom there is often an 
odour as if it came from the swamp; ana verily, I have eveiv 
heard the frog croak in it! 

Clever are they they have dexterous fingers: what aom my 



SCHOLARS 137 

simplicity pretend to beside their multiplicity! All threading 
and knitting and weaving do their fingers understand : thus do 
they make the hose of the spirit! 

Good clockworks are they: only be careful to wind them up 
properly! Then do they indicate the hour without mistake, and 
make a modest noise thereby. 

Like millstones do they work, and like pestles : throw only 
seed-corn unto them! they know well how to grind corn 
small, and make white dust out of it. 

They keep a sharp eye on one another, and do not trust each 
other the best. Ingenious in little artifices, they wait for those 
whose knowledge walketh on lame feet, like spiders do they 
wait. 

I saw them always prepare their poison with precaution; 
and always did they put glass gloves on their fingers in doing 
so. 

They also know how to play with false dice; and so eagerly 
did I find them playing, that they perspired thereby. 

We are alien to each other, and their virtues are even more 
repugnant to my taste than their falsehoods and false dice. 

And when I lived with them, then did I live above them. 
Therefore did they take a dislike to me. 

They want to hear nothing of any one walking above their 
heads; and so they put wood and earth and rubbish betwixt me 
and their heads. 

Thus did they deafen the sound of my tread : and least have 
I hitherto been heard by the most learned. 

All mankind s faults and weaknesses did they put betwixt 
themselves and me: they call it "false ceiling" in their 
houses. 

But nevertheless I walk with my thoughts above their heads; 



138 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

and even should I walk on mine own errors, still would I be 
above them and their heads. 

For men are not equal: so speaketh justice. And what I will, 
they may not will! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



. Poets 



M SiNCE I have known the body better" said Zarathustra tc 
one of his disciples "the spirit hath only been to me sym 
bolically spirit; and all the imperishable that is also but a 
simile." 

"So have I heard thee say once before," answered the dis 
ciple, "and then thou addedst: But the poets lie too much. 
Why didst thou say that the poets lie too much?" 

"Why?" said Zarathustra. "Thou askest why? I do not 
belong to those who may be asked after their Why. 

Is my experience but of yesterday? It is long ago that I ex 
perienced the reasons for mine opinions. 

Should I not have to be a cask of memory, if I also wanted to 
have my reasons with me? 

It is already too much for me even to retain mine opinions; 
and many a bird flieth away. 

And sometimes, also, do I find a fugitive creature in my 
dovecote, which is alien to me, and trembleth when I lay my 
hand upon it. 

But what did Zarathustra once say unto thee? That the poets 
lie too much? But Zarathustra also is a poet. 



POETS 139 

Believest thou that he there spake the truth? Why dost thou 
believe it?" 

The disciple answered: "I believe in Zarathustra." But 
Zarathustra shook his head and smiled. 

Belief doth not sanctify me, said he, leas*- of all the beliet 
in myself. 

But granting that some one did say in all seriousness that the 
poets lie too much: he was right we do lie too much. 

We also know too little, and are bad learners: so we are 
obliged to lie. 

And which of us poets hath not adulterated his wine? Many 
a poisonous hotchpotch hath evolved in our cellars : many an 
indescribable thing hath there been done. 

And because we know little, therefore are we pleased from 
the heart with the poor in spirit, especially when they are 
young women! 

And even of those things are we desirous, which old women 
tell one another in the evening. This do we call the eternally 
feminine in us. 

And as if there were a special secret access to knowledge, 
which choketh up for those who learn anything, so do we 
believe in the people and in their "wisdom." 

This, however, do all poets believe: that whoever pricketh 
up his ears when lying in the grass or on lonely slopes, learneth 
something of the things that are betwixt heaven and earth. 

And if there come unto them tender emotions, then do the 
poets always think that nature herself is in love with them : 

And that she stealeth to their ear to whisper secrets into it, 
and amorous flatteries: of this do they plume and pride them 
selves, before all mortals! 

Ah, f here are so many things betwixt heaven and earth of 
which only the poets have dreamed! 



140 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

And especially above the heavens: for all gods are poet- 
symbolisations, poet-sophistications! 

Verily, ever are we drawn aloft that is, to the realm of the

them gods and Supermen: 

Are not they light enough for those chairs! all these gods 
and Supermen? 

Ah, how I am weary of all the inadequate that is insisted on 
as actual! Ah, how I am weary of the poets! 

When Zarathustra so spake, his disciple resented it, but 
was silent. And Zarathustra also was silent; and his eye 
directed itself inwardly, as if it gazed into the far distance. At 
last he sighed and drew breath. 

I am of today and heretofore, said he thereupon; but some 
thing is in me that is of the morrow, and the day following, 
and the hereafter. 

I became weary of the poets, of the old and of the new: 
superficial are they all unto me, and shallow seas. 

They did not think sufficiently into the depth; therefore their 
feeling did not reach to the bottom. 

Some sensation of voluptuousness and some sensation of 
tedium: these have as yet been their best contemplation. 

Ghost-breathing and ghost-whisking, seemeth to me all the 
jingle- jangling of their harps; what have the} 7 known hitherto 
of the fervour of tones! 

They are also not pure enough for me: they all muddle their 
water that it may seem deep. 

And fain would they thereby prove themselves reconcilers: 
but mediaries and mixers are they unto me, and half-and-half, 
and impure! 

Ah, I cast indeed my net into thei r sea, and meant to catch 



POETS 141 

good fish; but always did I draw up the head of some ancient 
God. 

Thus did the sea give a stone to the hungry one. And they 
themselves may well originate from the sea. 

Certainly, one findeth pearls in them; thereby they are the 
more like hard molluscs. And instead of a. soul, I have often 
found in them salt slime. 

They have learned from the sea also its vanity: is not the 
sea the peacock of peacocks? 

Even before the ugliest of all buffaloes doth it spread out 
its tail; never doth it tire of its lace-fan of silver and silk. 

Disdainfully doth the buffalo glance thereat, nigh to the 
sand with its soul, nigher still to the thicket, nighest, however, 
to the swamp. 

What is beauty and sea and peacock-splendour to it! This 
parable I speak unto the poets. 

Verily, their spirit itself is the peacock of peacocks, and a 
sea of vanity! 

Spectators seeketh the spirit of the poet should they even 
be buffaloes! 

But of this spirit became I weary; and I see the time coming 
when it will become weary of itself. 

Yea, changed have I seen the poets, and their glance turned 
towards themselves. 

Penitents of the spirit have I seen appearing; they grew out 
of the poets. 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

40. Great Events 



THERE is an isle in the sea not far from the Happy Isles of 
Zarathustra on which a volcano ever smoketh; of which isle 
the people, and especially the old women amongst them, say 
that it is placed as a rock before the gate of the nether- world; 
but that through the volcano itself the narrow way leadeth 
downwards which conducteth to this gate. 

Now about the time that Zarathustra sojourned on the 
Happy Isles, it happened that a ship anchored at the isle on 
which standeth the smoking mountain, and the crew went 
ishore to shoot rabbits. About the noontide hour, however. 
when the captain and his men were together again, they saw 
suddenly a man coming towards them through the air, and a 
voice said distinctly: "It is time! It is the highest time!" But 
when the figure was nearest to them (it flew past quickly, how 
ever, like a shadow, in the direction of the volcano) , then did 
they recognise with the greatest surprise that it was Zarathus* 
tra; for they had all seen him before except the captain himself, 
and they loved him as the people love: in such wise that love 
and awe were combined in equal degree. 

"Behold!" said the old helmsman, "there goeth Zarathustra 
to hell!" 

About the same time that these sailors landed on the fire- 
isle, there was a rumour that Zarathustra had disappeared; and 
when his friends were asked about it, they said that he had 
gone on board a ship by night, without saying whither he was 
going. 

Thus there arose some uneasiness. After three days, how 
ever, there came the story of the ship s crew in addition to this 



GREAT EVENTS 143 

uneasiness and then did ail the people say that the devil had 
taken Zarathustra. His disciples laughed, sure enough, at this 
talk; and one of them said even: "Sooner would I believe that 
Zarathustra hath taken the devil." But at the bottom of their 
hearts they were all full of anxiety and longing: so their joy 
was great when on the fifth day Zarathustra appeared amongst 
them. 

And this is the account of Zarathustra s interview with the 
fire-dog: 

The earth, said he, hath a skin; and this skin hath diseases. 
One of these diseases, for example, is called "man." 

And another of these diseases is called "the fire-dog": con 
cerning him men have greatly deceived themselves, and let 
themselves be deceived. 

To fathom this mystery did I go o er the sea; and I have 
seen the truth naked, verily! barefooted up to the neck. 

Now do I know how it is concerning the fire-dog; and 
likewise concerning all the spouting and subversive devils, of 
which not only old women are afraid. 

"Up with thee, fire-dog, out of thy depth!" cried I, "and 
confess how deep that depth is! Whence cometh that which 
thou snortest up? 

Thou drinkest copiously at the sea: that doth thine embit 
tered eloquence betray! In sooth, for a dog of the depth, thou 
takest thy nourishment too much from the surface! 

At the most, I regard thee as the ventriloquist of the earth: 
and ever, when 1 have heard subversive and spouting devils 
speak, I have found them like thee: embittered, mendacious, 
and shallow. 

Ye understand how to roar and obscure with ashes! Ye are 
trie best braggarts, and have sufficiently learned the art of 
makir.g dregs boil. 



144 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Where ye are, there must always be dregs at hand, and much 
that is spongy, hollow, and compressed: it wanteth to have 
freedom. 

Freedom ye all roar most eagerly: but I have unlearned the 
belief in great events/ when there is much roaring and smoke 
about them. 

And believe me, friend Hullabaloo! The greatest events 
are not our noisiest, but our stillest hours. 

Not around the inventors of new noise, but around the in 
ventors of new values, doth the world revolve; tnaudibly it 
revolveth. 

And just own to it! Little had ever taken place when thy 
noise and smoke passed away. What, if a city did become a 
mummy, and a statue lay in the mud! 

And this do I say also to the o erthrowers of statues: It is 
certainly the greatest folly to throw salt into the sea, and statues 
into the mud. 

In the mud of your contempt lay the statue: but it is just its 
law, that out of contempt, its life and living beauty grow again! 

With diviner features doth it now arise, seducing by its 
suffering; and verily! it will yet thank you for o erthrowing it, 
ye subverters! 

This counsel, however, do I counsel to kings and churches, 
and to all that is weak with age or virtue let yourselves be 
o erthrown! That ye may again come to life, and that virtue 
may come to you! 

Thus spake I before the fire-dog: then did he interrupt me 
sullenly, and asked: "Church? What is that?" 

"Church?" answered I, "that is a kind of state, and indeed 
the most mendacious. But remain quiet, thou dissembling dog! 
Thou surely knowest thine own species best! 

Like thyself the state is a dissembling dog; like rnee doth 



GREAT EVENTS 145 

it like to speak with smoke and roaring to make believe, like 
thee, that it speaketh out of the heart of things. 

For it seeketh by all means to be the most important crea 
ture on earth, the state; and people think it so." 

When I had said this, the fire-dog acted as if mad with envy. 
"What!" cried he, "the most important creature on earth? And 
people think it so?" And so much vapour and terrible voices 
came out of his throat, that I thought he would choke with 
vexation and envy. 

At last he became calmer and his panting subsided; as soon, 
however, as he was quiet, I said laughingly: 

"Thou art angry, fire-dog: so I am in the right about thee: 

And that I may also maintain the right, hear the story of 
another fire-dog; he speaketh actually out of theheart of the 
earth. 

Gold doth his breath exhale, and golden rain: so doth his 
heart desire. What are ashes and smoke ind hot dregs to him! 

Laughter flitteth from him like a variegated cloud; adverse is 
he to thy gargling and spewing and grips in the bowels! 

The gold, however, and the laughter these doth he take 
out of the heart of the earth: for, that thou mayst know it, 
the heart of the earth is of gold." 

When the fire-dog heard this, he could no longer endure to 
listen to me. Abashed did he draw in his tail, said "bow-wow!" 
in a cowed voice, and crept down into his cave. 

Thus told Zarathustra. His disciples, however, hardly 
listened to him: so great was their eagerness to tell him about 
the sailors, the rabbits, and the flying man. 

"What am I to think of it!" said Zarathustra. "Am I indeed 
a ghost? 

But it may have been my shadow. Ye have surely heard some 
thing of the Wanderer and his Shadow? 



1-46 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

One thing, however, is certain: I must keep a tighter hold 
of it; otherwise it will spoil my reputation." 

And once more Zarathustra shook his head and wondered. 
"What am I to think of it!" said he once more. 

"Why did the ghost cry: It is time! It is the highest time! 

For what is it then- the highest time?" 

Ihus spake Zarathustra. 



41. The Soothsayer 



AND I saw a great sadness come over mankind. The best 
turned weary of their works. 

A doctrine appeared, a faith ran beside it: All is empty, all 
is alike, all hath been! 

And from all hills there re-echoed: All is empty, all is 
alike, all hath been! 

To be sure we have harvested : but why have all our fruits 
become rotten and brown? What was it fell last night from 
the evil moon? 

In vain was all our labour, poison hath our wine become, the 
evil eye hath singed yellow our fields and hearts. 

Arid have we all become; and fire falling upon us, then do 
we turn dust like ashes: yea, the fire itself have we made 
aweary. 

All our fountains have dried up, even the sea hath receded. 
All the ground trieth to gape, but the depth will not swallow! 

Alas! where is there still a sea in which one could be 
drowned? so soundetb our plaint across shallow swamps. 



THE SOOTHSAYER 147 

Verily, even for dying have we become too weary; now do 
we keep awake and live on in sepulchres." 

Thus did Zarathustra hear a soothsayer speak; and the ^ore- 
boding touched his heart and transformed him. Sorrowfully 
did he go about and wearily; and he became like unto those of 
whom the soothsayer had spoken. 

Verily, said he unto his disciples, a little while, and there 
cometh the long twilight. Alas, how shall I preserve my light 
through it! 

That it may not smother in this sorrowfulness! To remoter 
worlds shall it be a light, and also to remotest nights! 

Thus did Zarathustra go about grieved in his heart, and for 
three days he did not take any meat or drink: he had no rest, 
and lost his speech. At last it came to pass that he fell into a 
deep sleep. His disciples, however, sat around him in long 
night-watches, and waited anxiously to see if he would awake, 
and speak again, and recover from his affliction. 

And this is the discourse that Zarathustra spake when he 
awoke; his voice, however, came unto his disciples as from 
afar: 

Hear, I pray you, the dream that I dreamed, my friends, and 
help me to divine its meaning! 

A riddle is it still unto me, this dream; the meaning is hidden 
in it and encaged, and doth not yet fly above it on free pinions. 

All life had I renounced, so I dreamed. Night-watchman 
and grave-guardian had I become, aloft, in the lone mountain- 
fortress of Death. 

There did I guard his coffins : full stood the musty vaults of 
those trophies of victory. Out of glass coffins did vanquished 
life gaze upon me. 

The odour of dust-covered eternities did I breathe: sultry 



148 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

and dust-covered lay my soul. And who could have aired his 
soul there! 

Brightness of midnight was ever around me; lonesomeness 
cowered beside her; and as a third, death-rattle stillness, the 
worst of my female friends. 

Keys did I carry, the nastiest of all keys; and I knew how to 
open with them the most creaking of all gates. 

Like a bitterly angry croaking ran the sound through the 
long corridors when the leaves of the gate opened: ungra 
ciously did this bird cry, unwillingly was it awakened. 

But more frightful even, and more heart-strangling was it, 
when it again became silent and still all around, and I alone 
sat in that malignant silence. 

Thus did time pass with me, and slip by, if time there still 
was: what do I know thereof! But at last there happened that 
which awoke me. 

Thrice did there peal peals at the gate like thunders, thrice 
did the vaults resound and howl again: then did I go to the 
gate. 

Alpa! cried I, who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain? 
Alpa! Alpa! who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain? 

And I pressed the key, and pulled at the gate, and exerted 
myself. But not a finger s-breadth was it yet open : 

Then did a roaring wind tear the folds apart: whistling, 
whizzing, and piercing, it threw unto me a black coffin. 

And in the roaring and whistling and whizzing, the cofiin 
burst open, and spouted out a thousand peals of laughter. 

And a thousand caricatures of children, angels, owls, fools, 
and child-sized butterflies laughed and mocked, and roared at 
me 

Fearfully was I terrified thereby: it prostrated me. And I 
cried with horror as I ne er cried before. 



THE SOOTHSAYER 149 

But mine own crying awoke me: and I came to myself. 

Thus did Zarathustra relate his dream, and then was silent , 
for as yet he knew not the interpretation thereof. But the dis 
ciple whom he loved most arose quickly, seized Zarathustra s 
hand, and said : 

"Thy life itself interpreted! unto us this dream, G Zara 
thustra! 

Art thou not thyself the wind with shrill whistling, which 
bursteth open the gates of the fortress of Death? 

Art thou not thyself the coffin full of many-hued malices and 
angel-caricatures of life? 

Verily, like a thousand peals of children s laughter cometh 
Zarathustra into all sepulchres, laughing at those night-watch 
men and grave-guardians, and whoever else rattleth with sinis 
ter keys. 

With thy laughter wilt thou frighten and prostrate them: 
fainting and recovering wilt thou demonstrate thy power over 
them. 

And when the long twilight cometh and the mortal weari 
ness, even then wilt thou not disappear from our firmament, 
thou advocate of life! 

New stars hast thou made us see, and new nocturnal glories : 
verily, laughter itself hast thou spread out over us like a many- 
hued canopy. 

Now will children s laughter ever from coffins flow; now 
will a strong wind ever come victoriously unto all mortal weari 
ness: of this thou art thyself the pledge and the prophet! 

Verily, they themselves didst thou dream, thine enemies: 
that was thy sorest dream. 

But as thou awokest from them and earnest to thyself, so 
shall they awaken from themselves and come unto thee!" 

Thus spake the disciple; and all the others then thronged 



150 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

around Zarathustra, grasped him by the hands, and tried to 
persuade him to leave his bed and his sadness, and return unto 
them. Zarathustra, however, sat upright on his couch, with an 
absent look. Like one returning from long foreign sojourn did 
he look on his disciples, and examined their features; but still 
he knew them not. When, however, they raised him, and set 
him upon his feet, behold, all on a sudden his eye changed; he 
understood everything that had happened, stroked his beard, 
and said with a strong voice: 

"Well! this hath just its time; but see to it, my disciples, 
that we have a good repast, and without delay! Thus do I mean 
to make amends for bad dreams! 

The soothsayer, however, shall eat and drink at my side: 
and verily, I will yet show him a sea in which ntr can drown 
himself!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra. Then did he gaze long into the 
face of the disciple who had been the dream-interpreter, and 
shook his head. 



. Redemption 



WHEN Zarathustra went one day over the great bridge, then 
did the cripples and beggars surround him, and a hunchback 
spake thus unto him: 

"Behold, Zarathustra! Even the people learn from thee, and 
acquire faith in thy teaching: but for them to believe fully in 
thee, one thing is still needful thou must first of all convince 
us cripples! Here hast thou now a fine selection, and verily, an 



REDEMPTION 

opportunity with more than one forelock! The blind canst thou 
heal, and make the lame run; and from him who hath too 
much behind, couldst thou well, also, take away a little; 
that, I think, would be the right method to make the cripples 
believe in Zarathustra!" 

Zarathustra, however, answered thus unto him who so 
spake : When one taketh his hump from the hunchback, then 
doth one take from him his spirit so do the people teach. 
And when one giveth the blind man eyes, then doth he see too 
many bad things on the earth: so that he curseth him who 
healed him. He, however, who maketh the lame man run, in- 
flicteth upon him the greatest injury; for haidly can he run, 
when his vices run away with him so do the people teach 
concerning cripples. And why should not Zarathustra also 
learn from the people, when the people learn from Zara 
thustra? 

It is, however, the smallest thing unto me since I have been 
amongst men, to see one person lacking an eye, another an 
ear, and a third a leg, and that others have lost the tongue, or 
the nose, or the head. 

I see and have seen worse things, and divers things so 
hideous, that I should neither like to speak of all mattei$s, nor 
even keep silent about some of them: namely, men who lack 
everything, except that they have too much of one thing men 
who are nothing more than a big eye, or a big mouth, or a big 
belly, or something else big, reversed cripples, I call such 
men. 

And when I came out of my solitude, and for the first time 
passed over this bridge, then I could not trust mine eyes, but 
looked again and again, and said at last: "That is an ear! An 
ear as big as a man!" I looked still more attentively and ac- 



152 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

tually there did move under the ear something that was pitiably 
small and poor and slim. And in truth this immense ear was 
perched on a small thin stalk the stalk, however, was a man! 
A person putting a glass to his eyes, could even recognise fur 
ther a small envious countenance, and also that a bloated 
soullet dangled at the stalk. The people told me, however, that 
the big ear was not only a man, but a great man, a genius. But 
I never believed in the people when they spake of great men 
and I hold to my belief that it was a reversed cripple, who 
had too little of everything, and too much of one thing. 

When Zarathustra had spoken thus unto the hunchback, and 
unto those of whom the hunchback was the mouthpiece and 
advocate, then did he turn to his disciples in profound dejec 
tion, and said: 

Verily, my friends, I walk amongst men as amongst the 
fragments and limbs of human beings! 

This is the terrible thing to mine eye, that I find man 
broken up, and scattered about, as on a battle- and butcher- 
ground. 

And when mine eye fleeth from the present to the bygone, it 
nndeth ever the same: fragments and limbs and fearful chances 
but no men! 

The present and the bygone upon earth ah! my friends 
that is my most unbearable trouble; and I should not know how 
to live, if I were not a seer of .vhat is to come. 

A seer, a purposer, a creator, a future itself, and a bridge to 
the future and alas! also as it were a cripple on th s bridge: 
all that is Zarathustra. 

And ye also asked yourselves often: "Who is Zarathustra 
to us? What shall he be called by us?" And like me, did re 
give yourselves questions for answers. 

Is he a promiser? Or a fulfiller? A conqueror? Or an in- 



REDEMPTION 153 

heritor? A harvest? Or a ploughshare? A physician? Or a 
healed one? 

Is he a poet? Or a genuine one? An emancipator? Or a sub 
jugator? A good one? Or an evil one? 

I walk amongst men as the fragments of the future: that 
future which I contemplate. 

And it is all my poetisation and aspiration to compose and 
collect into unity what is fragment and riddle and fearful 
chance. 

And ho\v could I endure to be a man, if man were not also 
the composer, and riddle-reader, and redeemer of chance! 

To redeem what is past, and to transform every "It was" 
into "Thus would I have it!" that only do I call redemption! 

Will so is the emancipator and joy-bringer called: thus 
have I taught you, my friends! But now learn this likewise: 
the Will itself is still a prisoner. 

Willing emancipateth : but what is that called which still 
putteth the emancipator in chains? 

"It was": thus is the Will s teeth-gnashing and lonesomest 
tribulation called. Impotent towards what hath been done it 
is a malicious spectator of all that is past. 

Not backward can the Will will; that it cannot break time 
and time s desire that is the Will s lonesomest tribulation. 

Willing emancipateth: what doth Willing itself devise in 
order to get free from its tribulation and mock at its prison? 

Ah, a fool becometh every prisoner! Foolishly delivereth 
itself also the imprisoned Will. 

That time dotli not run backward that is its animosity: 
"That which was" : so is the stone which it cannot roll called. 

And thus doth it roll stones out of animosity and ill-humour, 
and taketh revenge on whatever doth not, like it, feel rage and 
ill-humour. 



154 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Thus did the Will, the emancipator, become a torturer; and 
on all that is capable of suffering it taketh revenge, because it 
cannot go backward. 

This, yea, this alone is revenge itself: the Will s antipathy to 
time, and its "It was." 

Verily, a great folly dwelleth in our Will; and it became a 
curse unto all humanity, that this folly acquired spirit! 

The spirit of revenge: my friends, that hath hitherto been 
man s best contemplation; and where there was suffering, it 
was claimed there was always penalty. 

"Penalty," so calleth itself revenge. With a lying word it 
f eigneth a good conscience. 

And because in the wilier himself there is suffering, because 
he cannot will backwards thus was Willing itself, and all 
life, claimed to be penalty! 

And then did cloud after cloud roll over the spirit, until at 
last madness preached: "Everything perisheth, therefore every 
thing deserveth to perish!" 

"And this itself is justice, the law of time that he must 
devour his children:" thus did madness preach. 

"Morally are things ordered according to justice and 
penalty. Oh, where is there deliverance from the flux of things 
and from the existence of penalty?" Thus did madness preach. 

"Can there be deliverance when there is eternal justice? 
Alas, unreliable is the stone, It was : eternal must also be all 
penalties!" Thus did madness preach. 

"No deed can be annihilated: how could it be undone by 
the penalty! This, this is what is eternal in the existence of 
penalty, that existence also must be eternally recurring deed 
and guilt! 

Unless the Will should at last deliver itself, and Willing 



REDEMPTION 155 

become non- Willing :" but ye know, my brethren, this fabu 
lous song of madness! 

Away from those fabulous songs did I lead you when I 
taught you: "The Will is a creator." 

All "It was" is a fragment, a riddle, a fearful chance until 
the creating Will saith thereto: "But thus would I have it." 

Until the creating Will saith thereto: "But thus do I will it! 
Thus shall I will it!" 

But did it ever speak thus? And when doth this take place? 
Hath the Will been unharnessed from its own folly? 

Hath the Will become its own deliverer and joy-bringer? 
Hath it unlearned the spirit of revenge and all teeth-gnashing? 

And who hath taught it reconciliation with time, and some 
thing higher than all reconciliation? 

Something higher than all reconciliation must the Will will 
which is the Will to Power : but how doth that take place? 
Who hath taught it also to will backwards? 

But at this point in his discourse it chanced that Zara- 
thustra suddenly paused, and looked like a person in the great 
est alarm. With terror in his eyes did he gaze on his disciples; 
his glances pierced as with arrows their thoughts and arrear- 
thoughts. But after a brief space he again laughed, and said 
soothedly: 

"It is difficult to live amongst men, because silence is so 
difficult especially for a babbler. "- 

Thus spake Zarathustra. The hunchback, however, had 
listened to the conversation and had covered his face during 
the time; but when he heard Zarathustra laugh, he looked up 
with curiosity, and said slowly: 

"But why doth Zarathustra speak otherwise unto us than 
unto his disciples?" 



156 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Zarathustra answered: "What is there to be wondered at! 
With hunchbacks one may well speak in a hunchbacked way!" 

"Very good," said the hunchback; "and with pupils one may 
well tell tales out of school. 

But why doth Zarathustra speak otherwise unto his pupils 
than unto himself?" 



. Manly Prudence 



NOT the height, it is the declivity that is terrible! 

The declivity, where the gaze shooteth downwards, and the 
hand graspeth upwards. There doth the heart become giddy 
through its double will. 

Ah, friends, do ye divine also my heart s double will? 

This, this is my declivity and my danger, that my gaze 
shooteth towards the summit, and my hand would fain clutch 
and lean on the depth! 

To man clingeth my will; with chains do I bind myself to 
man, because I am pulled upwards to the Superman: for 
thither doth mine other will tend. 

And therefore do I live blindly among men, as if I knew 
them not: that my hand may not entirely lose belief in 
firmness. 

I know not you men: this gloom and consolation is often 
spread around me. 

I sit at the gateway for every rogue, and ask : Who wisheth 
to deceive me? 

This is my first manly prudence, that I allow myself to be 
deceived, so as not to be on my guard against deceivers. 



MANLY PRUDENCE 157 

Ah, if I were on my guard against man, how could man be 
an anchor to my ball! Too easily would I be pulled upwards and 
away! 

This providence is over my fate, that I have to be without 
foresight. 

And he who would not languish amongst men, must learn 
to drink out of all glasses; and he who would keep clean 
amongst men, must know how to wash himself even with dirty 
water. 

And thus spake 1 often to myself for consolation: "Courage! 
Cheer up! old heart! An unhappiness hath failed to befall thee: 
enjoy that as thy happiness!" 

This, however, is mine other manly prudence: I am more 
forbearing to the vain than to the proud. 

Is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies? Where, 
however, pride is wounded, there there groweth up something 
better than pride. 

That life may be fair to behold, its game mus f , be well 
played; for that purpose, however, it needeth good actors. 

Good actors have I found all the vain ones : they play, and 
wish people to be fond of beholding them all their spirit is in 
this wish. 

They represent themselves, they invent themselves; in their 
neighbourhood I like to look upon life it cureth of mel 
ancholy. 

Therefore am I forbearing to the vain, because they are the 
physicians of my melancholy, and keep me attached to man 
as to a drama. 

And further, who conceiveth the full depth of the modesty 
of the vain man! I am favourable to him, and sympathetic on 
account of his modesty.

From you would he learn his belief in himself; he feedeth

about him: for in its depths sigheth his heart: "What am 7?" 

And if that be the true virtue which is unconscious of itself 
well, the vain man is unconscious of his modesty! 

This is, however, my third manly prudence: I am not put 
out of conceit with the wicked by your timorousness. 

I am happy to see the marvels the warm sun hatcheth: tigers 
and palms and rattlesnakes. 

Also amongst men there is a beautiful brood of the warm 
sun, and much that is marvellous in the wicked. 

In truth, as your wisest did not seem to me so very wise, so 
found I also human wickedness below the fame of it. 

And oft did I ask with a shake of the head: Why still rattle, 
ye rattlesnakes? 

Verily, there is still a future even for evil! And the warmest 
south is still undiscovered by man. 

How many things are now called the worst wickedness, 
which are only twelve feet broad and three months long! Some 
day, however, will greater dragons come into the world. 

For that the Superman may not lack his dragon, the super- 
dragon that is worthy of him, there must still much warm sun 
glow on moist virgin forests! 

Out of your wild cats must tigers have evolved, and out of 
your poison-toads, crocodiles: for the good hunter shall have a 
good hunt! 

And verily, ye good and just! In you there is much to be 
laughed at, and especially your fear of what hath hitherto been 
called "the devil!" 

So alien are ye in your souls to what is great, that to you the 
Superman would be frightful in his goodness! 



THE STILLEST HOUR 159 

And ye wise and knowing ones, ye would flee from the solar- 
glow of the wisdom in which the Superman joyfully batheth his 
nakedness! 

Ye highest men who have come within my ken! this is my 
doubt of you, and my secret laughter: I suspect ye would call 
my Superman a devil! 

Ah, I became tired of those highest and best ones: from 
their "height" did I long to be up, out, and away to the Super 
man! 

A horror came over me when I saw those best ones naked : 
then there grew for me the pinions to soar away into distant 
futures. 

Into more distant futures, into more southern souths than 
ever artist dreamed of: thither, where gods are ashamed of all 
clothes! 

But disguised do I want to see you, ye neighbours and 
fellowmen, and well-attired and vain and estimable, as "the 
good and just;" 

And disguised will I myself sit amongst you that I may 
mistake you and myself: for that is my last manly prudence. 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



44. The Stillest Hour 



WHAT hath happened unto me, my friends? Ye see me 
troubled, driven forth, unwillingly obedient, ready to go 
alas, to go away from you! 

Yea, once more must Zarathustra retire to his solitude: but 
unjoyously this time doth the bear go back to his cave! 



l6o THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

What hath happened unto me? Who ordereth this? Ah, 
mine angry mistress wisheth it so; she spake unto me. Have I 
ever named her name to you? 

Yesterday towards evening there spake unto me my stillest 
hour: that is the name of my terrible mistress. 

And thus did it happen for everything must I tell you, 
that your heart may not harden against the suddenly departing 
one! 

Do ye know the terror of him who falleth asleep? 

To the very toes he is terrified, because the ground giveth 
way under him, and the dream beginneth. 

This do I speak unto you in parable. Yesterday at the stillest 
hour did the ground give way under me: the dream began. 

The hour-hand moved on, the timepiece of my life drew 
breath never did I hear such stillness around me, so that my 
heart was terrified. 

Then was there spoken unto me without voice: "Thou 
knowest It, Zarathustra?" 

And I cried in terror at this whispering, and the blood left 
my face: but I was silent. 

Then was there once more spoken unto me without voice : 
"Thou knowest it, Zarathustra, but thou dost not speak it!" 

And at last I answered, like one defiant: "Yea, I know it, 
but I will not speak it!" 

Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: "Thou 
wilt not, Zarathustra? Is this true? Conceal thyself not behind 
thy defiance!" 

And I wept and trembled like a child, and said: "Ah, I 
would indeed, but how can I do it! Exempt me only from this! 
It is beyond my power!" 

Then was /-here again spoken unto me without voice : What 



THE STILLEST HOUR l6l 

matter about thyself, Zarathustra! Speak thy word, and suc 
cumb!" 

And I answered: "Ah, is it my word? Who am I? I await the 
worthier one; I am not worthy even to succumb by it." 

Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: "What 
matter about thyself? Thou art not yet humble enough for me. 
Humility hath the hardest skin." 

And I answered: "What hath not the skin of my humility 
endured! At the foot of my height do I dwell: how high are 
my summits, no one hath yet told me. But well do I know my 
valleys." 

Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: "O 
Zarathustra, he who hath to remove mountains removeth also 
valleys and plains." 

And I answered: "As yet hath my word not removed moun 
tains, and what I have spoken hath not reached man. I went, 
indeed, unto men, but not yet have I attained unto them." 

Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: "What 
knowest thou thereof! The dew f alleth on the grass when the 
night is most silent."- 

And I answered: "They mocked me when I found and 
walked in mine own path; and certainly did my feet then 
tremble. 

And thus did they speak unto me: Thou forgottest the path 
before, now dost thou also forget how to walk!" 

Then was there again spoken unto me without voice : "What 
matter about their mockery! Thou art one who hast unlearned 
to obey: now shalt thou command! 

Knowest thou not who is most needed by all? He who com- 
mandeth great things. 

To execute great things is difficult: but the more difficult 
task is to command great things. 



162 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

This is thy most unpardonable obstinacy: thou hast the 
power, and thou wilt not rule." 

And I answered: "I lack the lion s voice for all command 
ing." 

Then was there again spoken unto me as a whispering: "It 
is the stillest words which bring the storm. Thoughts that come 
with doves footsteps guide the world. 

O Zarathustra, thou shalt go as a shadow of that which is to 
come: thus wilt thou command, and in commanding go fore 
most." 

And I answered: "I am ashamed." 

Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: "Thou 
must yet become a child, and be without shame. 

The pride of youth is still upon thee; late hast thou become 
young: but he who would become a child must surmount even 
his youth." 

And I considered a long while, and trembled. At last, how 
ever, did I say what I had said at first. "I will not." 

Then did a laughing take place all around me. Alas, how 
that laughing lacerated my bowels and cut into my heart! 

And there was spoken unto me for the last time: "O Zara 
thustra, thy fruits are ripe, but thou art not ripe for thy fruits! 

So must thou go again into solitude: for thou shalt yet be 
come mellow." 

And again was there a laughing, and it fled : then did it be 
come still around me, as with a double stillness. I lay, however, 
on the ground, and the sweat flowed from my limbs. 

Now have ye heard all, and why I have to return into my 
solitude. Nothing have I kept hidden from you, my friends. 

But even this have ye heard from me, who is still the most 
Deserved of men and will be so! 

Ah, my friends! I should have something more to say unto 



THE oTILLEST HOUR 163 

you! I should have something more to give unto you! Why do 
I not give it? Am I then a niggard? 

When, however, Zarathustra had spoken these words, the 
violence of his pain, and a sense of the nearness of his de 
parture from his friends came over him, so that he wept aloud; 
and no one knew how to console him. In the night, however, 
he went away alone and left his friends.

"Ye look aloft when ye long for

cause I am exalted. 

"Who among you can at the same 
time laugh and be exalted ? 

"He who climbeth on the highest 
mountains, laugheth at all tragic plavs 
and tragic realities." ZARATHUSTRA, 
I., "Reading and Writing" (p. 56). 



. The Wanderer 



THEN, when k was about midnight, Zarathustra went his way 
over the ridge of the isle, that he might arrive early in the 
morning at the other coast; because there he meant to embark. 
For there was a good roadstead there, in which foreign ships 
also liked to anchor: those ships took many people with them, 
who wished to cross over from the Happy Isles. So when Zara 
thustra thus ascended the mountain, he thought on the way of 
his many solitary wanderings from youth onwards, and how 
many mountains and ridges and summits he had already 
climbed. , 

I am a wanderer and mountain climber, said he to his heart. 
I love not the plains, and it seemeth I cannot long sit still. 

And whatever may still overtake me as fate and experience 
a wandering will be therein, and a mountain-climbing: in 
the end one experienceth only oneself. 

The time is now past when accidents could befall me: and 
what could now fall to my lot which would not already be 
mine own! 

It returneth only, it cometh home to me at last mine own 
Self, and such of it as hath been long abroad, and scattered 
among things and accidents. 

And one thing more do I know : I stand now before my last 
summit, and before that which hath been longest reserved for 
me. Ah, my hardest path must I ascend! Ah, I have begun my 
lonesomest wandering! 

167 



l68 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

He, however, who is of my nature doth not avoid such an 
hour: the hour that saith unto him: Now only dost thou go 
the way to thy greatness! Summit and abyss these are now 
comprised together! 

Thou goest the way to thy greatness : now hath it become thy 
last refuge, what was hitherto thy last danger! 

Thou goest the way to thy greatness : it must now be thy best 
courage that there is no longer any path behind thee! 

Thou goest the way to thy greatness : here shall no one steal 
after thee! Thy foot itself hath effaced the path behind thee, 
and over it standeth written: Impossibility. 

And if all ladders henceforth fail thee, then must thou learn 
to mount upon thine own head : how couldst thou mount up 
ward otherwise? 

Upon thine own head, and beyond thine own heart! Now 
must the gentlest in thee become the hardest. 

He who hath always much-indulged himself, skkeneth at 
last by his much-indulgence. Praises on what maketh hardy! I 
do not praise the land where butter and honey flow! 

To learn to look away from oneself, is necessary in order to 
see many things: this hardiness is needed by every mountain- 
climber. 

He, however, who is obtrusive with his eyes as a discerner, 
how can he ever see more of anything than its foreground! 

But thou, O Zarathustra, wouldst view the ground of every 
thing, and its background : thus must thou mount even above 
thyself up, upwards, until thou hast even thy stars under 
thee! 

Yea! To look down upon myself, and even upon my stars: 
that only would I call my summit, that hath remained for me 
as my last summit! 



THE WANDERER la 

Thus spake Zarathustra to himself while ascending, com 
forting his heart with harsh maxims : for he was sore at heart as 
he had never been before. And when he had reached the top 
of the mountain-ridge, behold, there lay the other sea spread 
out before him; and he stood still and was long silent. The 
night, however, was cold at this height, and clear and starry. 

I recognise my destiny, said he at last, sadly. Well! I am 
ready. Now hath my last lonesomeness begun. 

Ah, this sombre, sad sea, below me! Ah, this sombre noc 
turnal vexation! Ah, fate and sea! To you must I now go down! 

Before my highest mountain do I stand, and before my 
longest wandering: therefore must I first go deeper down than 
I ever ascended : 

Deeper down into pain than I ever ascended, even into its 
darkest flood! So willeth my fate. Well! I am ready. 

Whence come the highest mountains? so did I once ask. 
Then did I learn that they come out of the sea. 

That testimony is inscribed on their stones, and on the walls 
of their summits. Out of the deepest must the highest come 
to its height. 

Thus spake Zarathustra on the ridge of the mountain wnete 
it was cold: when, however, he came into the vicinity of the 
sea, and at last stood alone amongst the cliffs, then had he De- 
come weary on his way, and eagerer than ever before. 

Everything as yet s/eepeth, said he; even the sea sleepeth. 
Drowsily and strangely doth its eye gaze upon me. 

But it breatheth warmly I feel it. And I feel also that it 
dreameth. It tosseth about dreamily on hard pillows. 

Hark! Hark! How it groaneth with evil recollections! Of 
evil exoectations? 



170 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Ah, I am sad along with thee, thou dusky monster, and 
angry with myself even for thy sake. 

Ah, that my hand hath not strength enough! Gladly, indeed, 
would I free thee from evil dreams! 

And while Zarathustra thus spake, he laughed at himself 
with melancholy and bitterness. What! Zarathustra, said he, 
wilt thou even sing consolation to the sea? 

Ah, thou amiable fool, Zarathustra, thou too-blindly con 
fiding one! But thus hast thou ever been: ever hast thou ap 
proached confidently all that is terrible. 

Every monster wouldst thou caress. A whiff of warm breath, 
a little soft tuft on its paw: and immediately wert thou ready 
to love and lure it. 

Love is the danger of the lonesomest one, love to anything, 
// / / only live! Laughable, verily, is my folly and my modesty in 
lovd 

Thus spake Zarathustra, and laughed thereby a second time. 
Then, however, he thought of his abandoned friends and as 
if he had done them a wrong with his thoughts, he upbraided 
himself because of his thoughts. And forthwith it came to pass 
that the laugher wept with anger and longing wept Zara 
thustra bitterly. 



THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA 



46. The Vision and the Enigma 



WHEN it got abroad among the sailors that Zarathustra was 
on board the ship for a man who came from the Happy Isles 
had gone on board along with him, there was great curiosity 
and expectation. But Zarathustra kept silent for two days, and 
was cold and deaf with sadness; so that he neither answered 
looks nor questions. On the evening of the second day, how 
ever, he again opened his ears, though he still kept silent: for 
there were many curious and dangerous things to be heard on 
board the ship, which came from afar, and was to go still fur 
ther. Zarathustra, however, was fond of all those who make 
distant voyages, and dislike to live without danger. And be 
hold! when listening, his own tongue was at last loosened, and 
the ice of his heart broke. Then did he begin to speak thus : 

To you, the daring venturers and adventurers, and whoever 
hath embarked with cunning sails upon frightful seas, 

To you the enigma-intoxicated, the twilight-enjoyers, whose 
souls are allured by flutes to every treacherous gulf: 

For ye dislike to grope at a thread with cowardly hand: 
and where ye can divine, there do ye hate to calculate 

To you only do I tell the enigma that I saw the vision of 
the lonesomest one. 

Gloomily walked I lately in corpse-coloured twilight 
gloomily and sternly, with Compressed lips. Not only one sun 
had set for me. 

A path which ascended daringly among boulders, an evil, 
lonesome path, ^hich neither herb nor shrub any longer 



172 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

cheered, a mountain-path, crunched under the daring of my 
foot. 

Mutely marching over the scornful clinking of pebbles, 
trampling the stone that let it slip : thus did my foot force its 
way upwards. 

Upwards: in spite of the spirit that drew it downwards, 
towards the abyss, the spirit of gravity, my devil and arch 
enemy. 

Upwards: although it sat upon me, half-dwarf, half -mole; 
paralysed, paralysing; dripping lead in mine ear, and thoughts 
like drops of lead into my brain. 

"O Zarathustra," it whispered scornfully, syllable by 
syllable, "thou stone of wisdom! Thou threwest thyself high, 
but every thrown stone must fall! 

Zarathustra, thou stone of wisdom, thou sling-stone, thou 
star-destroyer! Thyself threwest thou so high, but every 
thrown stone must fall! 

Condemned of thyself, and to thine own stoning: O Zara 
thustra, far indeed threwest thou thy stone but upon thyself 
will it recoil!" 

Then was the dwarf silent; and it lasted long. The silence, 
however, oppressed me; and to be thus in pairs, one is verily 
lonesomer than when alone! 

1 ascended, I ascended, I dreamt, I thought, but everything 
oppressed me. A sick one did I resemble, whom bad torture 
wearieth, and a worse dream reawakeneth out of his first 
sleep. 

But there is something in me which I call courage: it hath 
hitherto slain for me every dejection. This courage at last 
bade me stand still and say: "Dwarf! Thou! Or I!" 

For courage is the best slayer, courage which attacketh: 
for in every attack there is sound of triumph. 



THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA 173 

Man, however, is the most courageous animal : thereby hath 
he overcome every animal. With sound of triumph hath he 
overcome every pain; human pain, however, is the sorest pain. 

Courage slayeth also giddiness at abysses: and where doth 
man not stand at abysses! Is not seeing itself seeing abysses? 

Courage is the best slayer: courage slayeth also fellow-suffer 
ing. Fellow-suffering, however, is the deepest abyss : as deeply 
as man looketh into life, so deeply also doth he look into suf 
fering. 

Courage, however, is the best slayer, courage which at- 
tacketh: it slayeth even death itself; for it saith: "Was that 
life? Well! Once more!" 

In such speech, however, there is much sound of triumph. 
He who hath ears to hear, let him hear. 



"Halt, dwarf!" said I. "Either 1 or thou! I, however, am 
the stronger of the two: thou knowest not mine abysmal 
thought! // couldst thou not endure!" 

Then happened that which made me lighter: for the dwarf 
sprang from my shoulder, the prying sprite! And it squatted 
on a stone in front of me. There was however a gateway just 
where we haked. 

"Look at this gateway! Dwarf!" I continued, "it hath two 
faces. Two roads come together here: these hath no one yet 
gone to the end of. 

This long lane backwards: it continueth for an eternity. And 
that long lane forward that is another eternity. 

They are antithetical to one another, these roads; they 
directly abut on one another: and it is here, at this gateway 



174 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

that they come together. The name of the gateway is inscribed 
above: "This Moment. 

But should one follow them further and ever further and 
further on, thinkest thou, dwarf, that these roads would be 
eternally antithetical?" 

"Everything straight lieth," murmured the dwarf, con 
temptuously. "All truth is crooked; time itself is a circle." 

"Thou spirit of gravity!" said I wrathfully, "do not take it 
too lightly! Or I shall let thee squat where thou squattest, 
Haltfoot, and I carried thee htghV 

"Observe," continued I, "This Moment! From the gate 
way, This Moment, there runneth a long eternal lane back 
wards: behind us lieth an eternity. 

Must not whatever can run its course of all things, have 
already run along that lane? Must not whatever can happen of 
all things have already happened, resulted, and gone by? 

And if everything has already existed, what thinkest thou, 
dwarf, of This Moment? Must not this gateway also have 
already existed? 

And are not all things closely bound together in such wise 
that This Moment draweth all coming things after it? Cons? 
quently itself also? 

For whatever can run its course of all things, also in this 
long lane outward must it once more run I 
And this slow spider which creepeth in the moonlight, and 
this moonlight itself, and thou and I in this gateway whisper 
ing together, whispering of eternal things must we not all 
have already existed? 

And must we not return and run in that other lane out 
before us, that long weird lane must we not eternally re 
turn?" 

Thus did I speak, and always more softly: for I was afraid 



THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA 175 

of mine own thoughts, and arrear-thoughts. Then, suddenly 
did I hear a dog howl near me. 

Had I ever heard a dog howl thus? My thoughts ran back. 
Yes! When I was a child, in my most distant childhood : 

Then did 1 hear a dog howl thus. And saw it also, wivh 
hair bristling, its head upwards, trembling in the stillest mid 
night, when even dogs believe in ghosts : 

So that it excited my commiseration. For just then wem 
the full moon, silent as death, over the house; just then did it 
stand still, a glowing globe at rest on the flat roof, as if on 
some one s property: 

Thereby had the dog been terrified: for dogs believe in 
thieves and ghosts. And when I again heard such howling, then 
did it excite my commiseration once more. 

Where was now the dwarf? And the gateway? And the 
spider? And all the whispering? Had I dreamt? Had I 
awakened? Twixt rugged rocks did I suddenly stand alone, 
dreary in the dreariest moonlight. 

But there lay a man! And there! The dog leaping, bristling, 
whining now did it see me coming then did it howl again, 
then did it cry: had I ever heard a dog cry so for help? 

And verily, what I saw, the like had I never seen. A young 
shepherd did I see, writhing, choking, quivering, with dis 
torted countenance, and with a heavy black serpent hanging 
out of his mouth. 

Had I ever seen so much loathing and pale horror on one 
countenance? He had pernaps gone to sleep? Then had the 
serpent crawled into his throat there had it bitten itself fast. 

My hand pulled at the serpent, and pulled: in vain! I 
failed to pull the serpent out of his throat. Then there cried out 
of me: Bite! Bite! 

Its head off Bite!" so cried it out of me; my horror, my 



176 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

hatred, my loathing, my pity, all my good and my bad cried 
with one voice out of me. 

Ye daring ones around me! Ye venturers and adventurers, 
and whoever of you have embarked with cunning sails on unex 
plored seas: Ye enigma-enj overs! 

Solve unto me the enigma that I then beheld, interpret unto 
me the vision of the lonesomest one! 

For it was a vision and a foresight: what did I then behold 
in parable? And who is it that must come some day? 

Who is the shepherd into whose throat the serpent thus 
crawled? Who is the man into whose throat all the heaviest 
and blackest will thus crawl? 

The shepherd however bit as my cry had admonished 
him; he bit with a strong bite! Far away did he spit the head of 
the serpent: and sprang up. 

No longer shepherd, no longer man a transfigured being, a 
light-surrounded being, that laughed! Never on earth laughed 
a man as he laughed! 

O my brethren, I heard a laughter which was no human 
laughter, and now gnaweth a thirst at me, a longing that 
is never allayed. 

My longing for that laughter gnaweth at me: oh, how can I 
still endure to live! And how could I endure to die at present! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



INVOLUNTARY BLISS 177 

47 . Involuntary Bliss 

WITH such enigmas and bitterness in his heart did Zarathustra 
sail o er the sea. When, however, he was four day-journeys 
from the Happy Isles and from his friends, then had he sur 
mounted all his pain: triumphantly and with firm foot did 
he again accept his fate. And then talked Zarathustra in this 
wise to his exulting conscience : 

Alone am I again, and like to be so, alone with the pure 
heaven, and the open sea; and again is the afternoon around 
me. 

On an afternoon did I find my friends for the first time; on 
an afternoon, also, did I find them a second time: at the hour 
when all light becometh stiller. 

For whatever happiness is still on its way twixt heaven and 
earth, now seeketh for lodging a luminous soul: with happi 
ness hath all light now become stiller. 

O afternoon of my life! Once did my happiness also descend 
to the valley that it might seek a lodging: then did it find 
those open hospitable souls. 

O afternoon of my life! What did I not surrender that I 
might have one thing: this living plantation of my thoughts, 
and this dawn of my highest hope! 

Companions did the creating one once seek, and children of 
his hope: and lo, it turned out that he could not find them, 
except he himself should first create them. 

Thus am I in the midst of my work, to my children going, 
and from them returning: for the sake of his children must 
Zarathustra perfect himself. 



i-8 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

For in one s heart one loveth only one s child and one s 
work; and where there is great love to oneself, then is it the 
sign of pregnancy: so have I found it. 

Still are my children verdant in their first spring, standing 
nigh one another, and shaken in common by the winds, the 
trees of my garden and of my best soil. 

And verily, where such trees stand beside one another, there 
are Happy Isles! 

But one day will I take them up, and put each by itself alone: 
that it may learn lonesomeness and defiance and prudence. 

Gnarled and crooked and with flexible hardness shall it 
then stand by the sea, a living lighthouse of unconquerable life. 

Yonder where the storms rush down into the sea, and the 
snout of the mountain drinketh water, shall each on a time 
have his day and night watches, for his testing and recognition. 

Recognised and tested shall each be, to see if he be of my 
type and lineage: if he be master of a long will, silent even 
when he speaketh, and giving in such wise that he taketh in 
giving:- 

So that he may one day become my companion, a fellow- 
creator and fellow-enjoyer with Zarathustra: such a one as 
writeth my will on my tables, for the fuller perfection of all 
things. 

And for his sake and for those like him, must I perfect 
myself: therefore do I now avoid my happiness, and present 
myself to every misfortune for my final testing and recogni 
tion. 

And veriiy, it were time that I went away; and the wan 
derer s shadow and the longest tedium and the stillest hour- 
have all said unto me: "It is the highest time!" 

The word blew to me through the keyhole and said "Come " 
The door sprang subtly open unto me, and said "Go!" 



INVOLUNTARY BLISS 179 

But I lay enchained to my love for my children: desire 
spread this snare for me the desire for love that I should 
become the prey of my children, and lose myself in them. 

Desiring that is now for me to have lost myself. / possess 
you, my children! In this possessing shall everything be assur 
ance and nothing desire. 

But brooding lay the sun of my love upon me, in his own 
juice stewed Zarathustra, then did shadows and doubts fly 
past me. 

For frost and winter I now longed: "Oh, that frost and 
winter would again make me crack and crunch!" sighed I: 
then arose icy mist out of me. 

My past burst its tomb, many pains buried alike woke up: 
fully slept had they merely, concealed in corpse-clothes. 

So called everything unto me in signs: "It is time!" But I 
heard not, until at last mine abyss moved, and my thought bit 
me. 

Ah, abysmal thought, which art my thought! When shall I 
find strength to hear thee burrowing, and no longer tremble? 

To my very throat throbbeth my heart when I hear them 
burrowing! Thy muteness even is like to strangle me, thou 
abysmal mute one! 

As yet have I never ventured to call thee up; it hath been 
enough that I have carried thee about with me! As yet have I 
not been strong enough for my final lion-wantonness and 
playfulness. 

Sufficiently formidable unto me hath thy weight ever been: 
but one day shall I yet find the strength and the lion s voice 
which will call thee up! 

When I shall have surmounted myself therein, then will I 
surmount myself also in that which is greater; and a victory 
shall be the seal of my perfection!

I gaze , still see I no end. 

As yet hath the hour of my final struggle not come to me 
or doth it come to me perhaps just now? Verily, with insidious 
beauty do sea and life gaze upon me round about: 

O afternoon of my life! O happiness before eventide! O 
haven upon high seas! O peace in uncertainty! How I distrust 
all of you! 

Verily, distrustful am I of your insidious beauty! Like the 
lover am I, who distrusteth too sleek smiling. 

As he pusheth the best-beloved before him tender even in 
severity, the jealous one , so do I push this blissful hour be 
fore me. 

Away with thee, thou blissful hour! With thee hath there 
come to me an involuntary bliss! Ready for my severest pain 
do I here stand: at the wrong time hast thou come! 

Away with thee, thou blissful hour! Rather harbour there 
with my children! Hasten! and bless them before eventide with 
my happiness! 

There, already approacheth eventide: the sun sinketh. 
Away my happiness! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. And he waited for his misfortune 
the whole night; but he waited in vain. The night remained 
clear and calm, and happiness itself came nigher and nigher 
unto him. Towards morning, however, Zarathustra laughed to 
his heart, and said mockingly: "Happiness runneth after me. 
That is because I do not run after women. Happiness, however, 
is a woman." 



BEFORE SUNRISE l8l 

48. Before Sunrise 

o HEAVEN above me, thou pure, thou deep heaven! Thou 
abyss of light! Gazing on thee, I tremble with divine desires. 

Up to thy height to toss myself that is my depth! In thy 
purity to hide myself that is mine innocence! 

The God veileth his beauty: thus hidest thou thy stars. Thou 
speakest not: thus proclaimest thou thy wisdom unto me. 

Mute o er the raging sea hast thou risen for me to-day; thy 
love and thy modesty make a revelation unto my raging soul. 

In that thou earnest unto me beautiful, veiled in thy beauty, 
in that thou spakest unto me mutely, obvious in thy wisdom : 

Oh, how could I fail to divine all the modesty of thy soul! 
Before the sun didst thou come unto me the lonesomest one. 

We have been friends from the beginning: to us are grief, 
gruesomeness, and ground common; even the sun is common 
to us. 

We do not speak to each other, because we know too 
much : we keep silent to each other, we smile our knowl 
edge to each other. 

Art thou not the light of my fire? Hast thou not the sister- 
soul of mine insight? 

Together did we learn everything; together did we learn to 
ascend beyond ourselves to ourselves, and to smile uncloud- 
edly:- 

Uncloudedly to smile down out of luminous eyes and out 
of miles of distance, when under us constraint and purpose 
and guilt stream like rain. 

And wandered I alone, for what did my soul hunger by 
night and in labyrinthine paths? And climbed I mountains, 
whom did I ever seek, if not thee, upon mountains? 



t82 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

And all my wandering and mountain-climbing: a necessity 
was it merely, and a makeshift of the unhandy one: to fly 
only, wanteth mine entire will, to fly into thee! 

And what have I hated more than passing clouds, and what 
ever tainteth thee? And mine own hatred have I even hated, 
because it tainted thee! 

The passing clouds I detest those stealthy cats of prey: 
they take from thee and me what is common to us the vast 
unbounded Yea- and Amen-saying. 

These mediators and mixers we detest the passing clouds: 
those half-and-half ones, that have neither learned to bless 
nor to curse from the heart. 

Rather will I sit in a tub under a closed heaven, rather will 
I sit in the abyss without heaven, than see thee, thou luminous 
heaven, tainted with passing clouds! 

And oft have I longed to pin them fast with the jagged 
gold-wires of lightning, that I might, like the thunder, beat the 
drum upon their kettle-bellies: 

An angry drummer, because they rob me of thy Yea and 
Amen! thou heaven above me, thou pure, thou luminous 
heaven! Thou abyss of light! because they rob thee of my 
Yea. and Amen. 

For rather will I have noise and thunders and tempest-blasts, 
than this discreet, doubting cat-repose; and also amongst men 
do I hate most of all the soft-treaders, and half-and-half ones, 
and the doubting, hesitating, passing clouds. 

And ft he who cannot bless shall learn to curse!" this clear 
teaching dropt unto me from the clear heaven; this star 
standeth in my heaven even in dark nights. 

I, however, am a blesser and a Yea-sayer, if thou be but 
around me, thou pure, thou luminous heaven! Thou abyss of 



BEFORE SUNRISE 183 

light! into all abysses do I then carry my beneficent Yea-saying. 

A blesser have I become and a Yea-sayer: and therefore 
strove I long and was a striver, that I might one day get my 
hands free for blessing. 

This, however, is my blessing: to stand above everything 
as its own heaven, its round roof, its azure bell and eternal 
security: and blessed is he who thus blesseth! 

For all things are baptized at the font of eternity, and be 
yond good and evil; good and evil themselves, however, are 
but fugitive shadows and damp afflictions and passing clouds. 

Verily, it is a blessing and not a blasphemy when I teach 
that "above all things there standeth the heaven of chance, the 
heaven of innocence, the heaven of hazard, the heaven of wan 
tonness." 

"Of Hazard" that is the oldest nobility in the world; that/ 
gave I back to all things; I emancipated them from bondage) 
under purpose. 

This freedom and celestial serenity did I put like an azure 
bell above all things, when I taught that over them and through 
them, no "eternal Will" willeth. 

This wantonness and folly did I put in place of that Will, 
when I taught that "In everything there is one thing impossible 
rationality!" 

A little reason, to be sure, a germ of wisdom scattered from 
star to star this leaven is mixed in all things : for the sake of 
folly, wisdom is mixed in all things! 

A little wisdom is indeed possible; but this blessed security 
have I found in all things, that they prefer to dance on the 
feet of chance. 

O heaven above me! thou pure, thou lofty heaven! This is 
now thy purity unto me, that there is no eternal reason-spider 
and reason -cobweb: 



184 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

That thou art to me a dancing-floor for divine chances, 
that thou art to me a table of the Gods, for divine dice and dice- 
players! 

But thou blushest? Have. I spoken unspeakable things? Have 
I abused, when I meant to bless thee? 

Or is it the shame of being two of us that maketh thee blush 1 
Dost thou bid me go and be silent, because now day 
cometh? 

The world is deep: and deeper than e er the day could 
read. Not everything may be uttered in presence of day. But 
day cometh : so let us part! 

O heaven above me, thou modest one! thou glowing one! O 
thou, my happiness before sunrise! The day cometh: so let us 
part! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



. The Bedwarfing Virtue 



WHEN Zarathustra was again on the continent, he did not go 
straightway to his mountains and his cave, but made many 
wanderings and questionings, and ascertained this and that; 
so that he said of himself jestingly: "Lo, a river that floweth 
back unco its source in many windings ! For he wanted to learn 
what had taken place among men during the interval : whether 
they had become greater or smaller. And once, when he saw a 
row of new houses, he marvelled, and said: 



THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE 185 

"What do these houses mean? Verily, no great soul put them 
up as its simile! 

Did perhaps a silly child take them out of its toy-box? 
Would that another child put them again into the box! 

And these rooms and chambers can men go out and in 
there? They seem to be made for silk dolls; or for dainty-eaters, 
who perhaps let others eat with them." 

And Zarathustra stood still and meditated. At last he said 
sorrowfully: "There hath everything become smaller! 

Everywhere do I see lower doorways : he who is of my type 
can still go therethrough, but he must stoop! 

Oh, when shall I arrive again at my home, where I shall no 
longer have to stoop shall no longer have to stoop before the 
small ones!" And Zarathustra sighed, and gazed into the 
distance. 

The same day, however, he gave his discourse on the be 
dwarfing virtue. 



2 



I pass through this people and keep mine eyes open: they 
do not forgive me for not envying their virtues. 

They bite at me, because I say unto them that for small 
people, small virtues are necessary and because it is hard for, 
me to understand that small people are necessary! 

Here am I still like a cock in a strange farm-yard, at which 
even the hens peck: but on that account I am not unfriendly 
to the hens. 

I am courteous towards them, as towards all small annoy 
ances; to be prickly towards what is small, seemeth to me 
wisdom for hedgehogs. 



l86 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

They all speak of me when they sit around their fire in the 
evening they speak of me, but no one thinketh--of me! 

This is the new stillness which I have experienced: their 
noise around me spreadeth a mantle over my thoughts. 

They shout to one another: "What is this gloomy cloud 
about to do to us? Let us see that it doth not bring a plague 
upon us!" 

And recently did a woman seize upon her child that was 
coming unto me: "Take the children away," cried she, "such 
eyes scorch children s souls." 

They cough when I speak: they think coughing an objec 
tion to strong winds they divine nothing of the boisterous- 
ness of my happiness! 

"We have not yet time for Zarathustra" so they object; but 
what matter about a time that "hath no time" for Zarathustra? 

And if they should altogether praise me, how could I go to 
sleep on their praise? A girdle of spines is their praise unto 
me: it scratcheth me even when I take it ofl. 

And this also did I learn among them: the praiser doeth as 
if he gave back; in truth, however, he wanteth more to be given 
him! 

Ask my foot if their lauding and luring strains please it! 
Veriiy, to such measure and ticktack, it liketh neither to dance 
nor to stand still. 

To small virtues would they fain lure and laud me; to the 
ticktack of small happiness would they fain persuade my foot. 

I pass through this people and keep mine eyes open; they 
have become smaller, and ever become smaller: the reason 
thereof is their doctrine of happiness and virtue. 

For they are moderate also in virtue, because they want 
comfort. With comfort, however, moderate virtue only is com 
patible 



THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE 18; 

To be sure, they also learn in their way to stride on and stride 
forward: that, I call their hobbling. Thereby they become a 
hindrance to all who are in haste. 

And many of them go forward, and look backwards thereby, 
with stiffened necks : those do I like to run up against. 

Foot and eye shall not lie, nor give the lie to each other. Bui 
there is much lying among small people. 

Some of them will, but most of them are willed. Some of 
them are genuine, but most of them are bad actors. 

There are actors without knowing it amongst them, and 
actors without intending it , the genuine ones are always 
rare, especially the genuine actors. 

Of man there is little here: therefore do their women mascu 
linise themselves. For only he who is man enough, will save 
the woman in woman. 

And this hypocrisy found I worst amongst them, that even 
those who command feign the virtues of those who serve. 

"I serve, thou servest, we serve" so chanteth here even the 
hypocrisy of the rulers and alas! if the first lord be only the 
first servant! 

Ah, even upon their hypocrisy did mine eyes curiosity 
alight; and well did I divine all their fly-happiness, and their 
buzzing around sunny window-panes. 

So much kindness, so much weakness do I see. So much \ as- 
tice and pity, so much weakness. 

Round, fair, and considerate are they to one another, as 
grains of sand are round, fair, and considerate to grains of 
sand. 

Modestly to embrace a small happiness that do they call 
"submission"! and at the same time they peer modestly after 
i new small happiness. 

In. their hearts they want simply one thing most of all: tha* 



188 THUS SPAKE 2ARATHUSTRA 

no one hurt them. Thus do they anticipate every one s wishes 
and do well unto every one. 

That, however, is cowardice, though it be called "virtue." 

And when they chance to speak harshly, those small people, 
then do / hear therein only their hoarseness every draught of 
air maketh them hoarse. 

Shrewd indeed are they, their virtues have shrewd fingers. 
But they lack fists: their fingers do not know how to creep 
behind fists. 

Virtue for them is what maketh modest and tame: there 
with have they made the wolf a dog, and man himself man s 
best domestic animal. 

"We set our chair in the midst" so saith their smirking 
unto me "and as far from dying gladiators as from satisfied 
swine." 

That, however, is mediocrity, though it be called modera 
tion. - 



I pass through this people and let fall many words: but 
they know neither how to take nor how to retain them. 

They wonder why I came not to revile venery and vice; 
and verily, I came not to warn against pickpockets either! 

They wonder why I am not ready to abet and whet their 
wisdom: as if they had not yet enough of wiseacres, whose 
voices grate on mine ear like slate-pencils! 

And when I call out: "Curse all the cowardly devils in you, 
that would fain whimper and fold the hands and adore" 
then do they Hiout: "Zarathustra is godless." 



THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE 185 

And especially do their teachers of submission shout this; 
but precisely in their ears do I love to cry: "Yea! I am Zara- 
thustra, the godless!" 

Those teachers of submission! Wherever there is aught 
puny, or sickly, or scabby, there do they creep like lice; and 
only my disgust preventeth me from cracking them. 

Well! This is my sermon for their ears: I am Zarathustn 
the godless, who saith: "Who is more godless than I, that 1 
may enjoy his teaching?" 

I am Zarathustra the godless : where do I find mine equal? 
And all those are mine equals who give unto themselves their 
Will, and divest themselves of all submission. 

I am Zarathustra the godless! I cook every chance in my pot. 
And only when it hath been quite cooked do I welcome it as 
my food. 

And verily, many a chance came imperiously unto me: but 
still more imperiously did my Will speak unto it, then did it 
lie imploringly upon its knees 

Imploring that it might find home and heart with me, 
and saying flatteringly: "See, O Zarathustra, how friend only 
cometh unto friend!" 

But why talk I, when no one hath mine ears! And so will I 
shout it out unto all the winds : 

Ye ever become smaller, ye small people! Ye crumble away, 
ye comfortable ones! Ye will yet perish 

By your many small virtues, by your many smal] omis 
sions, and by your many small submissions! 

Too tender, too vi tiding: so is your soil! But for a tree to 
become great, it seeketh to twine hard roots around hard rocks! 

Also what ye omit weaveth at the web of all the human 
future; even your naught is a cobweb, and a spider that hvetb 
on the blood of the future. 



90 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

And when ye take, then is it like stealing, ye small virtuous 
ones; but even among knaves honour saith that "one shall only 
steal when one cannot rob." 

"It giveth itself" that is also a doctrine of submission 
Bu&gt; I say unto you, ye comfortable ones, that // taketh to itself, 
and will ever take more and more from you! 

Ah, that ye would renounce all half-wiiimg, and would de 
cide for idleness as ye decide for action! 

Ah, that ye understood my word: "Do ever what ye will 
but first be such as can w tll. 

Love ever your neighbour as yourselves but first be such 
as love themselves 

Such as love with great love, such as love with great con 
tempt!" Thus speaketh Zarathustra the godless. 

But why talk I, when no one hath mine ears! It is still an 
hour too early for me here. 

Mine own forerunner am I among this people, mine own 
cockcrow in dark lanes. 

But their hour cometh! And there cometh also mine! Hourly 
do they become smaller, poorer, unfruitfuller, poor herbs! 
poor earth! 

And soon shall they stand before me like dry grass and 
prairie, and verily, weary of themselves and panting for fire. 
more than for water! 

O blessed hour of the lightning! O mystery before noontide? 
Running fires will I one day make of them, and heralds with 
flaming tongues: 

Herald shall they one day with flaming tongues: It 
cometh, it is nigh, the great noontide! 

Thus spake Zarathustra 



ON THE OLIVE-MOUNT IOJ 

50. On the Olive-Mount 

WINTER, a bad guest, sitteth with me at home; blue are my 
hands with his friendly hand-shaking. 

I honour him, that bad guest, but gladly leave him alone. 
Gladly do I run away from him; and when one runneth weii&gt; 
then one escapeth him! 

With warm feet and warm thoughts do I run where the 
wind is calm to the sunny corner of mine olive-mount. 

There do I laugh at my stern guest, and am still fond of 
him; because he cleareth my house of flies, and quieteth manj 
little noises. 

For he suflereth it not if a gnat wanteth to buzz, or even 
two of them; also the lanes maketh he lonesome, so that the 
moonlight is afraid there at night. 

A hard guest is he, but I honour him, and do not wor* 
ship, like the tenderlings, the pot-bellied fire-idol. 

Better even a little teeth-chattering than idol-adoration! 
so willeth my nature. And especially have I a grudge against all 
ardent, steaming, steamy fire-idols. 

Him whom I love, I love better in winter than in summer; 
better do I now mock at mine enemies, and more heartily, 
when winter sitteth in my house. 

Heartily, verily, even when I creep into bed : there, still 
laugheth and wantoneth my hidden happiness; even my decep 
tive dream \augheth. 

I, a creeper? Never in my life did I creep before the power 
ful: and if ever I lied, then did I lie out of love. Therefore am 
I glad e^en in my winter-bed. 



THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

A poor bed warmeth me more than a rich one, foi 1 am jeal 
ous of my poverty. And in winter she is most faithful unto me. 

With a wickedness do I begin every day: I mock at the 
winter with a cold bath: on that account grumbleth my stern 
house-mate. 

Also do I like to tickle him with a wax-taper, that he may 
finally let the heavens emerge from ashy-grey twilight. 

For especially wicked am I in the morning: at the early 
hour when the pail rattleth at the well, and horses neigh 
warmly in grey lanes: 

Impatiently do I then wait, that the clear sky may finally 
dawn for me, the snow-bearded winter-sky, the hoary one, the. 
white-head, 

The winter-sky, the silent winter-sky, which often stifleth 
even its sun! 

Did I perhaps learn from it the long clear silence? Or did 
it learn it from me? Or hath each of us devised it himself? 

Of all good things the origin is a thousandfold, all good 
roguish things spring into existence for joy: how could they 
always do so for once only! 

A good roguish thing is also the long silence, and to look, 
like the winter-sky, out of a clear, round-eyed countenance: 

Like it to stifle one s sun, and one s inflexible solar will: 
verily, this art and this winter-roguishness have I learned well! 

My best-loved wickedness and art is it, that my silence hath 
learned not to betray itself by silence. 

Clattering with diction and dice, I outwit the solemn assist 
ants : all those stern watchers, shall my will and purpose elude 

That no one might see down into my depth and into mine 
ultimate will for that purpose did I devise the long clear 
silence. 



ON THE OLIVE-MOUNT 193 

Many a shrewd one did I find: he veiled his countenance and 
made his water muddy, that no one might see therethrough 
and thereunder. 

But precisely unto him came the shrewder distrusters and 
nut-crackers: precisely from him did rhey fish his best-con 
cealed fish! 

But the clear, the honest, the transparent these are for me 
the wisest silent ones : in them, so profound is the depth that 
even the clearest water doth not betray it. - 

Thou snow-bearded, silent, winter-sky, thou round-eyed 
whitehead above me! Oh, thou heavenly simile of my soul and 
its wantonness! 

And must I not conceal myself like one who hath swallowed 
gold lest my soul should be ripped up? 

Must I not wear stilts, that they may overlook my long legs 
all those enviers and injurers around me? 

Those dingy, fire-warmed, used-up, green-tinted, ill 
natured souls how could their envy endure my happiness! 

Thus do I show them only the ice and winter of my peaks 
and not that my mountain windeth all the solar girdles around 
it! 

They hear only the whistling of my winter-storms: and 
know not that I also travel over warm seas, like longing, heavy, 
hot south-winds. 

They commiserate also my accidents and chances: but my 
word saith: "Suffer the chance to come unto me: innocent is 
It as a little child!" 

How could they endure my happiness, if I did not put 
around it accidents, and winter-privations, and bear-skin caps, 
and enmantling snowflakes! 

If I did not myself commiserate their pity, the pity of 
those enviers and injurers! 



194 1IIUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

If I did not myself sigh before them, and chattel with 
cold, and patiently let myself be swathed in their pity! 

This is the wise waggish- will and good- will of my soul, that 
it concealeth not its winters and glacial storms; it concealeth 
not its chilblains either. 

To one man, lonesomeness is the flight of the sick one; to 
another, it is the flight from the sick ones. 

Let them hear me chartering and sighing with winter-cold, 
all those poor squinting knaves around me! With such sighing 
and chattering do I flee from their heated rooms. 

Let them sympathise with me and sigh with me on account 
of my chilblains: "At the ice of knowledge will he yet freeze 
to death!" so they mourn. 

Meanwhile do I run with warm feet hither and thither on 
mine olive-mount: in the sunny corner of mine olive-mount 
do I sing, and mock at all pity. 

Thus sang Zarathustra. 



. On Passing- By 



THUS slowly wandering through many peoples and divers 
cities, did Zarathustra return by round-about roads to his 
mountains and his cave. And behold, thereby came he un 
awares also to the gate of the great city. Here, however, a 
foaming fool, with extended hands, sprang forward to him and 
stood in his way. It was the same fool whom the people called 
"the ape of Zarathustra:" for he had learned from him some 
thing ~&gt;f the expression and modulation of language, and per- 



ONPASSING-BY J 95 

haps liked also to borrow from the store of his wisdom. Ana 
the fool talked thus to Zarathustra: 

O Zarathustra, here is the great city: here hast thou nothing 
to seek and everything to lose. 

Why wouldst thou wade through this mire? Have pity upon 
/hy foot! Spit rather on the gate of the city, and turn back! 

Here is the hell for anchorites thoughts: here are great 
thoughts seethed alive and boiled small. 

Here do all great sentiments decay: here may only rattle- 
boned sensations rattle! 

Smellest thou not already the shambles and cookshops of 
the spirit? Steameth not this city with the fumes of slaughtered 
spirit? 

Seest thou not the souls hanging like limp dirty rags? And 
they make newspapers also out of these rags! 

Hearest thou not how spirit hath here become a verbal 
game? Loathsome verbal swill doth it vomit forth! And they 
make newspapers also out of this verbal swill. 

They hound one another, and know not whither! They in 
flame one another, and know not why! They tinkle with their 
pinchbeck, they jingle with their gold. 

They are cold, and seek warmth from distilled waters : they 
are inflamed, and seek coolness from frozen spirits; they are 
all sick and sore through public opinion. 

All lusts and vices are here at home; but here there are also 
the virtuous; there is much appointable appointed virtue: 

Much appointable virtue with scribe-fingers, and hardy 
sitting-flesh and waiting-flesh, blessed with small breast-stars, 
and padded, haunchless daughters. 

There is here also much piety, and much faithful 
licking and spittle-backing, before the God of Hosts.

"From on high," drippeth the star, and the gracious spittle;

The moon hath its court, and the court hath its moon 
calves: unto all, however, that cometh from the court do the 
mendicant people pray, and all appointable mendicant virtues. 

"I serve, thou servest, we serve" so prayeth all appoint 
able virtue to the prince: that the merited star may at last stick 
on the slender breast! 

But the moon still revolveth around all that is earthly: so 
tevolveth also the prince around what is earthliest of all 
that, however, is the gold of the shopman. 

The God of the Hosts of wax is not the God of the golden 
bar; the prince proposeth, but the shopman disposeth! 

By all that is luminous and strong and good in thee, O Zara- 
thustra! Spit on this city of shopmen and return back! 

Here floweth all blood putridly and tepidly and frothily 
through all veins: spit on the great city, which is the great 
slum where all the scum frotheth together! 

Spit on the city of compressed souls and slender breasts, of 
pointed eyes and sticky fingers 

On the city of the obtrusive, the brazen-faced, the pen- 
demagogues and tongue-demagogues, the overheated ambi 
tious: 

Where everything maimed, ill-famed, lustful, untrustful, 
over-mellow, sickly-yellow and seditious, festereth perni 
ciously: 

Spit on the great city and turn back! 

Here, however, did Zarathustra interrupt the foaming fool, 
and shut his mouth. 

Stop this at once! called out Zarathustra, long have thy 
speech and thy species disgusted me! 



ON PASSING- BY 197 

Why didst thou live so long by the swamp, thac thou thy 
self hadst to become a frog and a toad? 

Floweth there not a tainted, frothy, swamp-blood in thine 
own veins, when thou hast thus learned to croak and revile? 

Why wentest thou not into the forest? Or why didst thou 
not till the ground? Is the sea not full of green islands? 

I despise thy contempt: and when thou wamedst me why 
didst thou not warn thyself? 

Out of love alone shall my contempt and my warning bird 
take wing; but not out of the swamp! - 

They call thee mine ape, thou foaming fool : but I call thee 
my grunting-pig, by thy grunting, thou spoilest even my 
praise of folly. 

What was it that first made thee grunt? Because no one 
sufficiently flattered thee: therefore didst thou seat thyself 
beside this filth, that thou mightest have cause for much grunt 
ing, 

That thou mightest have cause for much vengeance! For 
vengeance, thou vain fool, is all thy foaming; I have divined 
thee well! 

But thy fools -word injureth me, even when thou art right! 
And even if Zarathustra s word were a hundred times justified, 
thou wouldst ever do wrong with my word! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. Then did he look on the great city 
and sighed, and was long silent. At last he spake thus: 

I loathe also this great city, and not only this fool. Here and 
there there is nothing to better, nothing to worsen. 

Woe to this great city! And I would that I already saw the 
pillar of fire in which it will be consumed! 

For such pillars of fire must precede the great noontide. But

much honey of hope did I carry hence into my beehives! 

Those young hearts have already all become old and not 
old even! only weary, ordinary, comfortable: they declare it: 
"We have again become pious." 

Of late did I see them run forth at early morn with valorous 
steps : but the feet of their knowledge became weary, and now 
do they malign even their morning valour! 

Verily, many of them once lifted their legs like the dancer; 
to them winked the laughter of my wisdom: then did they 
beth nk themselves. Just now have I seen them bent down to 
creep to the cross. 

Around light and liberty did they once flutter like gnats and 
young poets. A little older, a little colder: and already are they 
mystiners, and mumblers and mollycoddles. 

Did perhaps their hearts despond, because lonesomeness 
had swallowed me like a whale? Did their ear perhaps- hearken 



THE APOSTATES 199 

yearningly- long for me in vain, and for my trumpet -notes and 
herald-calls? 

Ah! Ever are there but few of those whose hearts have 
persistent courage and exuberance; and in such remaineth also 
the spirit patient. The rest, however, are cowardly. 

The rest: these are always the great majority, the common 
place, the superfluous, the far-too many those all are 
cowardly! 

Him who is of my type, will also the experiences of my type 
meet on the way: so that his first companions must be corpses 
and buffoons. 

His second companions, however they will call themselves 
his believers, will be a living host, with much love, much 
folly, much unbearded veneration. 

To those believers shall he who is of my type among men 
not bind his heart; in those spring-times and many-hued 
meadows shall he not believe, who knoweth the fickly faint 
hearted human species! 

Could they do otherwise, then would they also will other 
wise. The half-and-half spoil every whole. That leaves become 
withered, what is there to lament about that! 

Let them go and fall away, O Zarathustra, and do not 
lament! Better even to blow amongst them with rustling 
winds, 

Blow amongst those leaves, O Zarathustra, that every 
thing withered may run away from thee the faster! 



"We have again become pious so do those apostates con 
fess; and some of them are still too pusillanimous thus tc

Unto them I look into the eye, before them I say it unto 
their face and unto the blush on their cheeks : Ye are those who 
again pray! 

It is however a shame to pray! Not for all, but for thee, anci 
me, and whoever hath his conscience in his head. For thee 
it is a shame to pray! 

Thou knowest it well : the faint-hearted devil in thee, which 
would fain fold its arms, and place its hands in its bosom, and 
take it easier: this faint-hearted devil persuadeth thee that 
"there is a God!" 

Thereby, however, dost thou belong to the light-dreading 
type, to whom light never permitteth repose: now must thou 
daily thrust thy head deeper into obscurity and vapour! 

And verily, thou choosest the hour well: for just now do the 
nocturnal birds again fly abroad. The hour hath come for all 
light-dreading people, the vesper hour and leisure hour, when 
they do not take leisure." 

I hear it and smell it: it hath come their hour for hunt and 
)procession, not indeed for a wild hunt, but for a tame, lame, 
snuffling, soft-treaders , soft-prayers hunt, 

For a hunt after susceptible simpletons : all mouse-traps 
for the heart have again been set! And whenever I lift a cur 
tain, a night-moth rusheth out of it. 

Did it perhaps squat there along with another night-moth? 
For everywhere do I smell small concealed communities; and 
wherever there are closets there are new devotees therein, and 
the atmosphere of devotees. 

They sit for long evenings beside one another, and say: "Let 
us again become like little children and say, good God! 
ruined in mouths and stomachs by the pious confectioners. 

Or they look for long evenings at a crafty, lurking cross- 



THE APOSTATES 2O1 

spider, that preacheth prudence to the spiders themselves, and 
teacheth that "under crosses it is good for cobweb-spinning!" 

Or they sit all day at swamps with angle-rods, and on that 
account think themselves profound; but whoever fisheth where 
there are no fish, I do not even call him superficial! 

Or they learn in godly-gay style to play the harp with a 
hymn-poet, who would fain harp himself into the heart of 
young girls: for he hath tired of old girls and their praises. 

Or they learn to shudder with a learned semi-madcap, who 
waiteth in darkened rooms for spirits to come to him and 
the spirit runneth away entirely! 

Or they listen to an old roving howl- and growl-piper, who 
hath learned from the sad winds the sadness of sounds; now 
pipeth he as the wind, and preacheth sadness in sad strains. 

And some of them have even become night-watchmen: they 
know now how to blow horns, and go about at night and 
awaken old things which have long fallen asleep. 

Five words about old things did I hear yesternight at the 
garden- wall: they came from such old, sorrowful, arid night 
watchmen. 

"For a father he careth not sufficiently for his children: 
human fathers do this better !"- 

"He is too old! He now careth no more for his children," 
answered the other night-watchman. 

"Hath he then children? No one can prove it unless he him 
self prove it! I have long wished that he would for once prove 
it thoroughly." 

"Prove? As if he had ever proved anything! Proving is diffi 
cult to him; he layeth great stress on one s believing him." 

"Ay! Ay! Belief saveth him; belief in him. That is the way 
with old people! So it is with us also!" 



202 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Thus spake to each other the two old night-watchmen and 
light-scarers, and tooted thereupon sorrowfully on their 
horns: so did it happen yesternight at the garden- wall. 

To me, however, did the heart writhe with laughter, and 
was like to break; it knew not where to go, and sunk into the 
midriff. 

Verily, it will be my death yet to choke with laughter when 
I see asses drunken, and hear night-watchmen thus doubt 
about God. 

Hath the time not long since passed for all such doubts? 
Who may nowadays awaken such old slumbering, light-shun 
ning things! 

With the old Deities hath it long since come to an end: 
and verily, a good joyful Deity-end had they! 

They did not "begloom" themselves to death that do 
people fabricate! On the contrary, they laughed themselves 
to death once on a time! 

That took place when the ungodliest utterance came from a 
God himself the utterance: "There is but one God! Thou 
shalt have no other gods before me!" 

An old grim-beard of a God, a jealous one, forgot him 
self in such wise: 

And all the gods then laughed, and shook upon their 
thrones, and exclaimed: "Is it not just divinity that there are 
gods, but no God?" 

He that hath an ear let him hear. 

Thus talked Zarathustra in the city he loved, which is sur- 
named "The Pied Cow." For from here he had but two days 
to travel to reach once more his cave and his animals; his soul, 
however, rejoiced unceasingly on account of the nighness of 
his return home. 



THE RETURN HOME 203 

. The Return Home 



O LONESOMENESS! my home, lonesomeness! Too long have I 
lived wildly in wild remoteness, to return to thee without tears! 

Now threaten me with the finger as mothers threaten; now 
smile upon me as mothers smile; now say just: "Who was it 
that like a whirlwind once rushed away from me? 

Who when departing called out: Too long have I sat 
with lonesomeness; there have I unlearned silence! That hast 
thou learned now surely? 

O Zarathustra, everything do I know; and that thou wert 
more forsaken amongst the many, thou unique one, than thou 
ever wert with me! 

One thing is forsakenness, another matter is lonesomeness : 
that hast thou now learned! And that amongst men thou wilt 
ever be wild and strange: 

Wild and strange even when they love thee: for above all 
they want to be treated indulgently! 

Here, however, art thou at home and house with thyself; 
here canst thou utter everything, and unbosom all motives; 
nothing is here ashamed of concealed, congealed feelings. 

Here do all things come caressingly to thy talk and flatter 
thee: for they want to ride upon thy back. On every simile dost 
thou here ride to every truth. 

Uprightly and openly mayest thou here talk to all things: 
and verily, it soundeth as praise in their ears, for one to talk 
to all things directly! 

Another matter, however, is forsakenness. For, dost thou re 
member, O Zarathustra? When thy bird screamed overhead,. 



204 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

when thou stoodest in the forest, irresolute, ignorant where to 
go, beside a corpse: 

When thou spakest: Let mine animals lead me! More 
dangerous have I found it among men than among animals : 
That was forsakenness! 

And dost thou remember, O Zarathustra? When thou sattest 
in thine isle, a well of wine giving and granting amongst empty 
buckets, bestowing and distributing amongst the thirsty: 

Until at last thou alone sattest thirsty amongst the 
drunken ones, and wailedst nightly: Is taking not more 
blessed than giving? And stealing yet more blessed than 
taking? That was forsakenness! 

And dost thou remember, O Zarathustra? When thy stillest 
hour came and drove thee forth from thyself, when with 
wicked whispering it said: Speak and succumb! 

When it disgusted thee with all thy waiting and silence, 
and discouraged thy humble courage: That was forsaken 



ness! 



O lonesomeness! My home, lonesomeness! How blessedly 
and tenderly speaketh thy voice unto me! 

We do not question each other, we do not complain to each 
other; we go together openly through open doors. 

For all is open with thee and clear; and even the hours run 
here on lighter feet. For in the dark, time weigheth heavier 
Upon one than in the light. 

Here rly open unto me all beings words and word-cabinets: 
here all being wanteth to become words, here all becoming 
wanteth to learn of me how to talk. 

Down there, however all talking is in vain! There, for 
getting and passing-by are the best wisdom: that have I learned 



now! 



THE RETURN HOME 

He who would understand everything in man must handle 
everything. But for that I have too clean hands. 

I do not like even to inhale their breath; alas! that I have 
lived so long among their noise and bad breaths! 

O blessed stillness around me! O pure odours around me! 
How from a deep breast this stillness fetcheth pure breath! 
How it hearkeneth, this blessed stillness! 

But down there there speaketh everything, there is every 
thing misheard. If one announce one s wisdom with bells, the 
shopmen in the market-place will out- jingle it with pennies! 

Everything among them talketh; no one knoweth any longer 
how to understand. Everything falleth into the water; nothing 
f alleth any longer into deep wells. : 

Everything among them talketh, nothing succeedeth any 
longer and accomplisheth itself. Everything cackleth, but who 
will still sit quietly on the nest and hatch eggs? 

Everything among them talketh, everything is out-talked. 
And that which yesterday was still too hard for time itself and 
its tooth, hangeth today, outchamped and outchewed, from 
the mouths of the men of today. 

Everything among them talketh, everything is betrayed. And 
what was once called the secret and secrecy of profound souls, 
belongeth to-day to the street-trumpeters and other butterflies. 

O human hubbub, thou wonderful thing! Thou noise in 
dark streets! Now art thou again behind me: my greatest 
danger lieth behind me! 

In indulging and pitying lay ever my greatest danger; and 
all human hubbub wisheth to be indulged and tolerated. 

With suppressed truths, with fool s hand and befooled 
heart, and rich in petty lies of pity: thus have I ever Jived 
among men. 



206 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Disguised did I sit amongst them, ready to misjudge myself 
that I might endure them, and willingly saying to myself: 
"Thou fool, thou dost not know men!" 

One unlearneth men when one liveth amongst them: there 
is too much foreground in all men what can far-seeing, far- 
longing eyes do there! 

And, fool that I was, when they misjudged me, 1 indulged 
them on that account more than myself, being habitually hard 
on myself, and often even taking revenge on myself for the 
indulgence. 

Stung all over by poisonous flies, and hollowed like the 
stone by many drops of wickedness : thus did I sit among them, 
and still said to myself: "Innocent is everything petty of its 
pettiness!" 

Especially did I find those who call themselves "the good," 
the most poisonous flies; they sting in all innocence, they lie 
in all innocence; how could they be just towards me! 

He who liveth amongst the good pity teacheth him to lie. 
Pity maketh stifling air for all free souls. For the stupidity of 
the good is unfathomable. 

To conceal myself and my riches that did I learn down 
there: for every one did I still find poor in spirit. It was the lie 
of my pity, that I knew in every one. 

That I saw and scented in every one, what was enough of 
spirit for him, and what was too much! 

Their stiff wise men: I call them wise, not stiff thus did i 
learn to slur over words. 

The grave-diggers dig for themselves diseases. Under old 
rubbish rest bad vapours. One should not stir up the marsh. 
One should live on mountains. 

With blessed nostrils do I again breathe mountain- freedom, 



THE THREE EVIL THINGS 207 

Freed at last is my nose from the smell of all human hubbub! 
With sharp breezes tickled, as with sparkling wine, sneezeth 
my soul sneezeth, and shouteth self-congratulatingly: 
"Health to thee!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



. The Three Evil Things 



IN MY dream, in my last morning-dream, I stood today on a 
promontory beyond the world; I held a pair of scales, and 
weighed the world. 

Alas, that the rosy dawn came too early to me: she glowed 
me awake, the jealous one! Jealous is she always of the glows of 
my morning-dream. 

Measurable by him who hath time, weighable by a good 
weigher, attainable by strong pinions, divinable by divine nut 
crackers: thus did my dream find the world: 

My dream, a bold sailor, half-ship, half -hurricane, silent as 
the butterfly, impatient as the falcon : how had it the patience 
and leisure to-day for world-weighing! 

Did my wisdom perhaps speak secretly to it, my laughing, 
wide-awake day-wisdom, which mocketh at all "infinite 
worlds"? For it saith: "Where force is, there becometh number 
the master: it hath more force." 

How confidently did my dream contemplate this finite 



-208 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

world, not riew-fangledly, not old-fangledly, not timidly, not 
entreatingly: 

As if a big round apple presented itself to my hand, a 
ripe golden apple, with a coolly-soft, velvety skin: thus did 
the world present itself unto me: 

As if a tree nodded unto me, a broad-branched, strong- 
willed tree, curved as a recline and a foot-stool for weary 
travellers : thus did the world stand on my promontory: 

As if delicate hands carried a casket towards me a casket 
open for the delectation of modest adoring eyes: thus did the 
world present itself before me today: 

Not riddle enough to scare human love from it, not solu 
tion enough to put to sleep human wisdom: a humanly good 
thing was the world to me to-day, of which such bad things are 
said! 

How I thank my morning-dream that I thus at today s 
dawn, weighed the world! As a humanly good thing did it 
come unto me, this dream and heart-comforter! 

And that I may do the like by day, and imitate and copy its 
best, now will I put the three worst things on the scales, and 
weigh them humanly well. 

He who taught to bless taught also to curse: what are the 
three best cursed things in the world? These will I put on the 
scales. 

Voluptuousness, passion for power, and selfishness: these 
three things have hitherto been best cursed, and have been in 
worst and falsest repute these three things will I weigh 
humanly well. 

Well! here is my promontory, and there is the sea // 
rolleth hither unto me, shaggily and f awningly, the old, faith 
ful, hundred-headed dog-monster that I love! 

Well! Here will I hold the scales over the weltering sea: and 



THE THREE EVIL THINGS 209 

also a witness do I choose to look on thee, the anchorite-tree, 
thee, the strong-odoured, broad-arched tree that I love! 

On what bridge goeth the now to the hereafter? By what 
constraint doth the high stoop to the low? And what enjoineth 
even the highest still to grow upwards? 

Now stand the scales poised and at rest: three heavy ques 
tions have I thrown in; three heavy answers carrieth the other 
scale. 



Voluptuousness : unto all hair-shirted despisers of the body, 
a sting and stake; and, cursed as "the world," by all back- 
worldsmen: for it mocketh and befooleth all erring, misin- 
f erring teachers. 

Voluptuousness: to the rabble, the slow fire at which it is 
burnt; to all wormy wood, to all stinking rags, the prepared 
heat and stew furnace. 

Voluptuousness: to free hearts, a thing innocent and free, 
the garden-happiness of the earth, all the future s thanks-over 
flow to the present. 

Voluptuousness: only to the withered a sweet poison; to 
the lion-willed, however, the great cordial, and the reverently 
saved wine of wines. 

Voluptuousness: the great symbolic happiness of a higher 
happiness and highest hope. For to many is marriage promised, 
and more than marriage, 

To many that are more unknown to each other than man 
and woman: and who hath fully understood how unknoum 
to each other are mail and woman! 

Voluptuousness: but I will have hedges around my 



210 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

thoughts, and even around my words, lest swine and liber 
tine should break into my gardens! 

Passion for power: the glowing scourge of the hardest of 
the heart-hard; the cruel torture reserved for the cruellest 
themselves; the gloomy flame of living pyres. 

Passion for power: the wicked gadfly which is mounted on 
the vainest peoples; the scorner of all uncertain virtue; which 
rideth on every horse and on every pride. 

Passion for power: the earthquake which breaketh and up- 
breaketh all that is rotten and hollow; the rolling, rumbling, 
punitive demolisher of whited sepulchres; the flashing inter 
rogative-sign beside premature answers. 

Passion for power: before whose glance man creepeth and 
croucheth and drudgeth, and becometh lower than the serpent 
and the swine: until at last great contempt crieth out of 
him , 

Passion for power: the terrible teacher of great contempt, 
which preacheth to their face to cities and empires: "Away 
with thee!" until a voice crieth out of themselves: "Away 
with me!" 

Passion for power: which, however, mounteth alluringly 
even to the pure and lonesome, and up to self-satisfied eleva 
tions, glowing like a love that painteth purple felicities allur 
ingly on earthly heavens. 

Passion for power: but who would call it passion, when the 
height longeth to stoop for power! Verily, nothing sick or dis 
eased is there in such longing and descending! 

That the lonesome height may not forever remain lone 
some and self-sufficing; that the mountains may come to the 
valleys and the winds of the heights to the plains: 

Oh, who could find the right prenomen and honouring name 



THE THREE EVIL THINGS 211 

for such longing! "Bestowing virtue" thus did Zarathustra 
once name the unnamable. 

And then it happened also, and verily, it happened for the 
first time! tlwt his word blessed selfishness, the wholesome, 
healthy selfishness, that springeth from the powerful soul: 

From the powerful soul, to which the high body apper- 
taineth, the handsome, triumphing, refreshing body, around 
which everything becometh a mirror: 

The pliant, persuasive body, the dancer, whose symbol 
and epitome is the self -en joying soul. Of such bodies and souls 
the self -enjoyment calleth itself "virtue." 

With its words of good and bad doth such self -enjoyment 
shelter itself as with sacred groves; with the names of its hap 
piness doth it banish from itself everything contemptible. 

Away from itself doth it banish everything cowardly; it 
saith: "Bad that is cowardly!" Contemptible seem to it the 
ever-solicitous, the sighing, the complaining, and whoever 
pick up the most trifling advantage. 

It despiseth also all bitter-sweet wisdom: for verily, there is 
also wisdom that bloometh in the dark, a night-shade wisdom, 
which ever sigheth: "All is vain!" 

Shy distrust is regarded by it as baje, and every one who 
wanteth oaths instead of looks and hands: also all over-dis 
trustful wisdom, for such is the mode of cowardly souls. 

Baser still it regardeth the obsequious, doggisn one, who 
immediately lieth on his back, the submissive one; and there is 
also wisdom that is submissive, and doggish, and pious, and 
obsequious. 

Hateful to it altogether, and a loathing, is he who will never 
defend himself, he who swalloweth down poisonous spittle 
and bad looks, the all-too-patient one, the all-endurer, che all- 
satisfied one: for that is the mode of slaves. 



212 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Whether they be servile before gods and divine spurnings. 
or before men and stupid human opinions : at all kinds of slaves 
doth it spit, this blessed selfishness! 

Bad : thus doth it call all that is spirit-broken, and sordidly- 
servile constrained, blinking eyes, depressed hearts, and the 
false submissive style, which kisseth with broad cowardly lips. 

And spurious wisdom: so doth it call all the wit that slaves, 
and hoary-headed and weary ones affect; and especially all the 
cunning, spurious- witted, curious-witted foolishness of priests! 

The spurious wise, however, all the priests, the world-weary, 
and those whose souls are of feminine and servile nature oh, 
how hath their game all along abused selfishness! 

And precisely that was to be virtue and was to be called 
virtue to abuse selfishness! And "selfless" so did they wish 
themselves with good reason, all those world-weary cowards 
and cross-spiders! 

But to all those cometh now the day, the change, the sword 
of judgment, the great noontide: then shall many things be 
revealed! 

And he who proclaimeth the ego wholesome and holy, and 
selfishness blessed, verily, he, the prognosticator, speaketh also 
what he knoweth: "Behold, it cometh, it is night, the great 
noontide!" 

Ihus spake Zarathusua. 



THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY 



The Spirit of Gravity 



MY MOUTHPIECE is of the people: too coarsely and cordially 
do I talk for Angora rabbits. And still stranger soundeth my 
word unto all ink-fish and pen-foxes. 

My hand is a fool s hand: woe unto all tables and walls, 
and whatever hath room for fool s sketching, fool s scrawling! 

My foot is a horse-foot; therewith do I trample and trot 
over stick and stone, in the fields up and down, and am be 
devilled with delight in all fast racing. 

My stomach is surely an eagle s stomach? For it preferreth 
lamb s flesh. Certainly it is a bird s stomach. 

Nourished with innocent things, and with few, ready and 
impatient to fly, to fly away that is now my nature: why 
should there not be something of bird-nature therein! 

And especially that I am hostile to the spirit of gravity, 
that is bird-nature: verily, deadly hostile, supremely hostile, 
originally hostile! Oh, whither hath my hostility not flown 
and misflown! 

Thereof could I sing a song and will sing it: though i 

be alone in an empty house, and must sing it to mine own ears. 

Other singers are there, to be sure, to whom only the full 
house maketh the voice soft, the hand eloquent, the eye ex 
pressive, the heart wakeful: those do I not resemble. 



THUS SPAKE ZAR/THUSTRA 



He who one day teacheth men to fly will have shifted all 
landmarks; to him will all landmarks themselves fly into the 
air; the earth will he christen anew as "the light body." 

The ostrich runneth faster than the fastest horse, but it also 
thrusteth its head heavily into the heavy earth: thus is it with 
the man who cannot yet fly. 

Heavy unto him are earth and life, and so wtlleth the spirit 
of gravity! But he who would become light, and be a bird, 
must love himself : thus do / teach. 

Not, to be sure, with the love of the sick and infected, for 
with them stinketh even self-love! 

One must learn to love oneself thus do I teach with a 
wholesome and healthy love: that one may endure to be with 
oneself, and not go ro\ing about. 

Such roving about christeneth itself "brotherly love"; with 
these words hath there hitherto been the best lying and dis 
sembling, and especially by those who have been burdensome 
to every one. 

And verily, it is no commandment for today and tomorrow 
to learn to love oneself. Rather is it of all arts the finest, 
subtlest, last and patientest. 

For to its possessor is all possession well concealed, and of all 
treasure-pits one s own is last excavated so causeth the spirit 
of gravity. 

Almost in the cradle are we apportioned with heavy words 
and worths: "good" and "evil" so calleth itself this dowry. 
For the sake of it we are forgiven for living. 

And therefore suffereth one little children to come unto one, 



THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY 215 

to forbid them betimes to love themselves so causeth the 
spirit of gravity. 

And we we bear loyally what is apportioned unto us, on 
hard shoulders, over rugged mountains! And when we sweat, 
then do people say to us: Yea, life is hard to bear!" 

But man himself only is hard to bear! The reason thereof 
is that he carrieth too many extraneous things on his shoul 
ders. Like the camel kneeleth he down, and letteth himself be 
well laden. 

Especially the strong load-bearing man in whom reverence 
resideth. Too many extraneous heavy words and worths 
loadeth he upon himself then seemeth life to him a desert! 

And verily! Many a thing also that is our own is hard to 
bear! And many internal things in man are like the oyster 
repulsive and slippery and hard to grasp; 

So that an elegant shell, with elegant adornment, must plead 
for them. But this art also must one learn: to have a shell, and 
a fine appearance, and sagacious blindness! 

Again, it deceiveth about many things in man, that many a 
shell is poor and pitiable, and too much of a shell. Much con 
cealed goodness and power is never dreamt of; the choicest 
dainties find no tasters! 

Women know that, the choicest of them: a little fatter a 
little leaner oh, how much fate is in so little! 

Man is difficult to discover, and unto himself most difficult 
of all; often lieth the spirit concerning the soul. So causeth the 
spkit of gravity. 

. He, however, hath discovered himself who saith: This is my 
good and evil: therewith hath he silenced the mole and the 
dwarf, who say: "Good for all, evil for all." 

Verily, neither do I like those who call everything good, and 
this world the best of all. Those do I call the all-satisfied. 



2l6 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

All-satisfiedness, which knoweth how to taste everything, 
that is not the best taste! I honour the refractory, fastidious 
tongues and stomachs, which have learned to say "I" and 
"Yea" and "Nay." 

To chew and digest everything, however that is the genu 
ine swine-nature! [Ever to say YE-A that hath only the ass 
learned, and those like it!-- 

Deep yellow and hot reel -so wanteth my taste it mixeth 
blood with all colours. He, however, who whitewasheth his 
house, betray eth unto me a whitewashed soul. 

With mummies, some fall in love; others with phantoms: 
both alike hostile to all flesh and blood oh, how repugnant 
are both to my taste! For I love blood. 

And there will I not reside and abide where every one 
spitt^th and speweth: that is now my taste, rather would I 
)ive amongst thieves and perjurers. Nobody carrieth gold in 
his mouth. 

Still more repugnant unto me, however, are all lick-spittles; 
and the most repugnant animal of man that I found, did I 
christen "parasite": it would not love, and would yet live by 
love. 

Unhappy do I call all those who have only one choice: 
either to become evil beasts, or evil beast-tamers. Amongst such 
would I not build my tabernacle. 

Unhappy do I also call those who have ever to wait, they 
are repugnant to my taste all the toll-gatherers and traders, 
and kings, and other landkeepers and shopkeepers. 

Verily, I learned waiting also, and thoroughly so, but only 
waiting for myself. And above all did I learn standing and 
walking and running and leaping and climbing and dancing. 

This however is my teaching: he who wishtth one day to fly, 



THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY 2iy 

must first learn standing and walking and running and climb 
ing and dancing: one doth not fly into flying! 

With rope-ladders learned I to reach many a window, with 
nimble legs did I climb high masts: to sit on high masts of 
perception seemed to me no small bliss; 

To flicker like small flames on high masts: a small light, 
certainly, but a great comfort to cast-away sailors and ship 
wrecked ones! 

By divers ways and wendings did I arrive at my truth; nof 
by one ladder did I mount to the height where mine eye roveth 
into my remoteness. 

And unwillingly only did I ask my way that was always 
counter to my taste! Rather did I question and test the ways 
themselves. 

A testing and a questioning hath been all my travelling: 
and verily, one must also learn to answer such questioning! 
That, however, is my taste: 

Neither a good nor a bad taste, but my taste, of which i 
have no longer either shame or secrecy. 

"This is now my way, where is yours?" Thus did i 
answer those who asked me "the way." For the way it doth 
not exist! 

Thus spake Zarathustra.

T. Old and New Tables 



HERE do I sit and wait, old broken tables around me and 
also new half -written tables. When cometh mine hour? 

The hour of my descent, of my down-going: for once 
more will I go unto men. 

For that hour do I now wait: for first must the signs come 
unto me that it is mine hour namely, the laughing lion with 
the flock of doves. 

Meanwhile do I talk to myself as one who hath time. No one 
telleth me anything new, so I tell myself mine own story.

When I came unto men, then found I them resting on an 
old infatuation: all of them thought they had long known 
v/nai: was good and bad for men. 

An old wearisome business seemed to them all discourse 
about virtue; and he who wished to sleep well spake of "good" 
and "bad" ere retiring to rest. 

This somnolence did I disturb when I taught that no one 
yet knoweth what is good and bad: unless it be the creating 
one! 

It is he, however, who createth man s goal, and giveth to 
the earth its meaning and its future: he only effecteth it that 
aught is good or bad. 

And I bade them upset their old academic chairs, and 



OLD AND NEW TABLES 219 

wherever that old infatuation had sat; I bade them laugh at 
their great moralists, their saints, their poets, and their 
saviours. 

At their gloomy sages did I bid them laueh, and whoever 
had sat admonishing as a black scarecrow on the tree of life. 

On their great grave-highway did I seat mvself , and even 
beside the carrion and vultures and I laughed at all then 
bygone and its mellow decaying glory. 

Verily, like penitential preachers and fools did I cry wrath 
and shame on all their greatness and smallness. Oh, that their 
best is so very small! Oh, that their worst is so very small! 
Thus did I laugh. 

Thus did my wise longing, born in the mountains, cry and 
laugh in me; a wild wisdom, verily! my gre?t pinion- 
rustling longing. 

And oft did it carry me off and up and away and in the midst 
of laughter; then flew I quivering like an arrow with sun- 
intoxicated rapture: 

Out into distant futures, which no dream hath yet seen, 
into warmer souths than ever sculptor conceived, where gods 
in their dancing are ashamed of all clothes : 

(That I may speak in parables and halt and stammer like the 
poets: and verily I am ashamed that I have still to be a poet!) 

Where all becoming seemed to me dancing of gods, and 
wantoning of gods, and the world unloosed and unbridled and 
fleeing back to itself: 

As an eternal self-fleeing and re-seeking of one another 
of many gods, as the blessed self-contradicting, recommun- 
ing, and refraternising with one another of many gods: 

Where all time seemed to me a blessed mockery of moments, 
where necessity was freedom itself, whirh played happily witn 
the goad of freedom: 



220 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Where I also found again mine old devil and arch-enemy, 
Jhe spirit of gravity, and all that it created: constraint, law, 
necessity and consequence and purpose and will and good and 
svil: 

For must there not be that which is danced over, danced be 
yond? Must there not, for the sake of the nimble, the nimblest 
moles and clumsy dwarfs? 



There was it also where I picked up from the path the word 
"Superman," and that man is something that must be sur 
passed. 

That man is a bridge and not a goal rejoicing over hi& 
noontides and evenings, as advances to new rosy dawns: 

The Zarathustra word of the great noontide, and what 
ever else I have hung up over men like purple evening- after 
glows. 

Verily, also new stars did I make them see, along with new 
nights; and over cloud and day and night, did I spread out 
laughter like a gay-coloured canopy. 

I taught them all my poetisation and aspiration: to com 
pose and collect into unity what is fragment in man, and riddle 
and fearful chance; 

As composer, riddle-reader, and redeemer of chance, did 
I teach them to create the future, and all that hath been to re 
deem by creating. 

The past of man to redeem, and every "It was" to transform, 
until the Will saith: "But so did I will it! So shall I will it " 
This did I call redemption; this alone taught I them to 
call redemption. 



OLD AND NEW TABLES 221 

Now do I await my redemption that I may go unto them 
for the last time. 

For once more will I go unto men: amongst them will my 
sun set; in dying will I give them my choicest gift! 

From the sun did I learn this, when it goeth down, the 
exuberant one: gold doth it then pour into the sea, out of in 
exhaustible riches, 

So that the poorest fisherman roweth even with golden 
oars! For this did I once see, and did not tire of weeping in 
beholding it. 

Like the sun will also Zarathustra go down : now sitteth he 
here and waiteth, old broken tables around him, and also new 
tables half-written.

Behold, here is a new table; but where are my brethren who 
will carry it with me to the valley and into hearts of flesh? 

Thus demandeth my great love to the remotest ones: be not 
considerate of thy neighbour! Man is something that must be 
surpassed. 

There are many divers ways and modes of surpassing: see 
thou thereto! But only a buffoon thinketh: "man can also be 
overleapt." 

Surpass thyself even in thy neighbour: and a right which 
thou canst seize upon, shalt thou not allow to be given thee! 

What thou doest can no one do to thee again. Lo, there is no 
requital. 

He who cannot command himself shall obey. And many a 
one can command himself, but still sorely lacketh self-obedi 
ence!

Thus wisheth the type of noble souls: they desire to havf- 
nothing gratuitously, least of all, life. 

He who is of the populace wisheth to live gratuitously; we 
others, however, to whom life hath given itself we are ever 
considering what we can best give in return! 

And verily, it is a noble dictum which saith: "What life 
promiseth us, that promise will we keep to life!" 

One should not wish to enjoy where one doth not contribute 
to the enjoyment. And one should not wish to enjoy! 

For enjoyment and innocence are the most bashful things 
Neither like to be sought for. One should have them, but one 
should rather seek for guilt and pain!

O my brethren, he who is a firstling is ever sacrificed. Now, 
however, are we firstlings! 

We all bleed on secret sacrificial altars, we all burn and 
broil in honour of ancient idols. 

Our best is still young: this exciteth old palates. Our flesh 
is tender, our skin is only lambs skin: how could we not 
excite old idol-priests! 

In ourselves dwelleth he still, the old idol-priest, who 
broileth our best for his banquet. Ah, my brethren, how coula 
firstlings fail to be sacrifices! 

But so wisheth our type; and I love those who do not wish 
tc preserve themselves, the down-going ones do I love with 
mine entire iove: for they go beyond.

To be true that can few be! And he who can, will not f . 
Least of all, however, can the good be true. 

Oh, those good ones! Good men never speak the truth. For 
the spirit, thus to be good, is a malady. 

They yield, those good ones, they submit themselves; theii 
heart repeateth, their soul obeyeth : he, however, who obeyeth v 
doth not listen to himself! 

All that is called evil by the good, must come together in 
order that one truth may be born. O my brethren, are ye also 
evil enough for this truth? 

The daring venture, the prolonged distrust, the cruel Nay, 
the tedium, the cutting- into-the-quick how seldom do these 
come together! Out of such seed, however is truth produced! 

Beside the bad conscience hath hitherto grown all knowl 
edge! Break up. break up, ye discerning ones, the old tables!

When the water hath planks, when gangways and railings 
o erspan the stream, verily, he is not believed who then saith: 
"All is in flux." 

But even the simpletons contradict him. "What?" say the

stream! 

"Over the stream all is stable, all the values of things, the 
bridges and bearings, all good and evil : these are all

Cometh, however, the hard winter, the stream-tamer, then

"Fundamentally standeth everything still" that is an ap 
propriate winter doctrine, good cheer for an unproductive 
period, a great comfort for winter-sleepers and fireside- 
loungers. 

"Fundamentally standeth everything still" : but contrary 
thereto, preach eth the thawing wind! 

The thawing wind, a bullock, which is no ploughing bullock 
a furious bullock, a destroyer, which with angry horns 
breaketh the ice! The ice however breaketh gangways! 

O my brethren, is not everything at present m flux? Have 
not all railings and gangways fallen into the water? Who 
would still hold on to "good" and "evil"? 

"Woe to us! Hail to us! The thawing wind bloweth!" 
Thus preach, my brethren, through all the streets!

There is an old illusion it is called good and evil. Around 
soothsayers and astrologers hath hitherto revolved the orbit of 
this illusion. 

Once did one believe in soothsayers and astrologers; and 
therefore did one believe, "Everything is fate: thou shalt, for 
thou must!" 

Then again did one distrust all soothsayers and astrologers; 
and therefore did one believe, "Everything is freedom: thou 
canst, for thou wiliest!" 

O my brethren, concerning the stars and the future there

therefore concerning good and evil there hath hitherto been 
only illusion and not knowledge!

"Thou shalt not rob! Thou sLalt not slay!" such precepts 
were once called holy; before them did one bow the knee and

But I ask you: Where have there ever been better robbers 
and slayers in the world than such holy precepts? 

Is there not even in all life robbing and slaying? And for 
such precepts to be called holy, was not truth itself thereby 
slain? 

Or was it a sermon of death that called holy what contra 
dicted and dissuaded from life? O my brethren, break up, 
break up for me the old tables!

It is my sympathy with all the past that I see it is aban 
doned, 

Abandoned to the favour, the spirit and the madness of 
every generation that cometh, and reinterpreted! all that hath 
been as its bridge! 

A great potentate might arise, an artful prodigy, who with 
approval and disapproval could strain and constrain all the 
past, until it became for him a bridge, a harbinger, a herald, 
and a cock-crowing. 



226 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

This however is the other danger, and mine other sympathy: 
he who is of the populace, his thoughts go back to his grand 
father, with his grandfather, however, doth time cease. 

Thus is all the past abandoned : for it might some day hap 
pen for the populace to become master, and drown all time in 
shallow waters. 

Therefore, O my brethren, a new nobility is needed, which 
shall be the adversary of all populace and potentate rule, and 
shall inscribe anew the word "noble" on new tables. 

For many noble ones are needed, and many kinds of noble 
ones, for a new nobility! Or, as I once said in parable: "That is 
just divinity, that there are gods, but no God!" 



O my brethren, I consecrate you and point you to a new 
nobility: ye shall become procreators and cultivators and 
sowers of the future; 

Verily, not to a nobility which ye could purchase like 
traders with traders gold; for little worth is all that hath its 
price. 

Let it not be your honour henceforth whence ye come, but 
whither ye go! Your Will and your feet which seek to surpass 
you let these be your new honour! 

Verily, not that ye have served a prince of what account 
are princes now! nor that ye have become a bulwark to that 
which standeth, that it may stand more firmly. 

Not that your family have become courtly at courts, and that 
ye have learned gay-coloured, like the flamingo to stand 
long hours in shallow pools : 

(For ability-to-st&nd is a merit in courtiers; and all cour- 



OLD AND NEW TABLES 22y 

tiers believe that unto blessedness after death pertaineth per- 
mission-to-sitl ) 

Nor even that a Spirit called Holy, led your forefathers into 
promised lands, which I do not praise: for where the worst of 
all trees grew the cross, in that land there is nothing to 
praise! 

And verily, wherever this "Holy Spirit" led its knights, 
always in such campaigns did goats and geese, and wry- 
heads and guy-heads run foremost! 

O my brethren, not backward shall your nobility gaze, but 
outward! Exiles shall ye be from all fatherlands and forefather- 
lands! 

Your children s land shall ye love: let this love be your ne\v 
nobility, the undiscovered in the remotest seas! For it do I bid 
your sails search and search! 

Unto your children shall ye make amends for being the chil 
dren of your fathers: all the past shall ye thus redeem! This 
new table do I place over you! 



"Why should one live? All is vain! To live that is to 
thresh straw; to live that is to burn oneself and yet not get 
warm." 

Such ancient babbling still passeth for "wisdom", because 
it is old, however, and smelleth mustily, therefore is it the more 
honoured. Even mould ennobleth. 

Children might thus speak: they shun the fire because it hath 
burnt them! There is much childishness in the old books of 
wisdom. 



228 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

And he who ever "thresheth straw," why should he be 
allowed to rail at threshing! Such a fool one would have to 
muzzle! 

Such persons sit down to the table and bring nothing with 
them, not even good hunger: and then do they rail: "All is 
vain!" 

But to eat and drink well, my brethren, is verily no vain art! 
Break up, break up for me the tables of the never- joyous ones!

monster." 

For these are all unclean spirits; especially those, however, 
who have no peace or rest, unless they see the world from the 
backside the backworldsmen! 

To those do I say it to the face, although it sound unpleas 
antly: the world resembleth man, in that it hath a backside, 
so much is true! 

There is in the world much filth: so much is true! But the 
world itself is not therefore a filthy monster! 

There is wisdom in the fact that much in the world smelleth 
badly: loathing itself createth wings, and fountain-divining 
powers! 

In the best there is still something to loathe; and the best is 
still something that must be surpassed!

filth is in the world!

"Let whoever will choke and stab and skin and scrape the 
people: raise not a ringer against it! Thereby will they learn 
to renounce the world." 

"And thine own reason this shalt thou thyself stifle and 
choke; for it is a reason of this world, thereby wilt thou learn

"He who learneth much unlearneth all violent cravings"

"Wisdom wearieth, nothing is worth while; thou shalt not

markets. 

Break up for me, O my brethren, break up also that new 
table! The weary-o -the- world put it up, and the preachers of 
death and the jailer: for lo, it is also a sermon for slavery: 

Because they learned badly and not the best, and everything 
too early and everything too fast; because they ate badly: from 
thence hath resulted their ruined stomach;

For a ruined stomach, is their spirit: // persuadeth to 
death! For verily, my brethren, the spirit is a stomach! 

Life is a well of delight, but to him in whom the ruined 
stomach speaketh, the father of affliction, all fountains are 
poisoned. 

To discern: that is delight to the lion- willed! But he who 
hath become weary, is himself merely "willed"; with him play 
all the waves. 

And such is always the nature of weak men: they lose them 
selves on their way. And at last asketh their weariness: "Why 
did we ever go on the way? All is indifferent!" 

To them soundeth it pleasant to have preached in their ears : 
"Nothing is worth while! Ye shall not will!" That, however, 
is a sermon for slavery. 

O my brethren, a fresh blustering wind cometh Zarathustra 
unto all way- weary ones; many noses will he yet make sneeze! 

Even through walls bloweth my free breath, and into 
prisons and imprisoned spirits! 

Willing emancipateth : for willing is creating: so do I teach. 
And only for creating shall ye learn! 

And also the learning shall ye learn only from me, the

Not in vain doth your lip hang down: a small worldly 
wish still sitteth thereon! And in your eye floateth there not 
a cloudlet of unforgotten earthly bliss? 

There are on the earth many good inventions, some useful, 
some pleasant: for their sake is the earth to be loved. 

And many such good inventions are there, that they are like 
woman s breasts: useful at the same time, and pleasant. 

Ye world-weary ones, however! Ye earth-idlers! You, shall 
one beat with stripes! With stripes shall one again make you 
sprightly limbs. 

For if ye be not invalids, or decrepit creatures, of whom the 
earth is weary, then are ye sly sloths, or dainty, sneaking 
pleasure-cats. And if ye will not again run gaily, then shall ye 
pass away! 

To the incurable shall one not seek to be a physician : thus

But more courage is needed to make an end than to make a

A span-breadth from his goal, to languish! Verily, ye will

Let him lie, until of his own accord he awakeneth, until of 
his own accord he repudiated! all weariness, and what weari

But wherever ye would ascend with me, O my brethren, take

A parasite: that is a reptile, a creeping, cringing reptile,

And this is its art: it divineth where ascending souls are

For the soul which hath the longest ladder, and can go 
deepest down: how could there fail to be most parasites upon 
it? 

-The most comprehensive soul, which can run and stray 
and rove furthest in itself; the most necessary soul, which out 
of joy flingeth itself into chance: 

The soul in Being, which plungeth into Becoming; the 
possessing soul, which seeketh to attain desire and longing: 

The soul fleeing from itself, which overtaketh itself in 
the widest circuit; the wisest soul, unto which folly speaketh 
most sweetly: 

The soul most self -loving, in which all things have thei 
current and counter-current, their ebb and their flow: oh, 
how could the loftiest soul fail to have the worst parasites?

Ye shall only have foes to be hated; but not foes to be 
despised: ye must be proud of your foes. Thus have I already 
taught. 

For the worthier foe, O my brethren, shall ye reserve your 
selves : therefore must ye pass by many a one, 

Especially many of the rabble, who din your ears with 
noise about people and peoples. 

Keep your eye clear of their For and Against! There is there

Therefore shall they have it hard! 

Better beasts of prey shall they thus become, subtler,

On that account want I the honest ones to say to one an

"Give us a set term and a small marriage, that we may

Thus do I counsel all honest ones; and what would be my

to say, many attempting ones. 

Who can command, who must obey that is there at 
tempted! Ah, with what long seeking and solving and failing 
and learning and re-attempting! 

Human society: it is an attempt so I teach a long seek 
ing: it seeketh however the ruler! - 

An attempt, my brethren! And no "contract"! Destroy, I 
pray you, destroy that word of the soft-hearted and half-and- 
half! 



O my brethren! With whom lieth the greatest danger to the 
whole human future? Is it not with the good and just? 

As those who say and feel in their hearts: "We already 
know what is good and just, we possess it also; woe to those 
who still seek thereafter!" 

And whatever harm the wicked may do, the harm of the 
good is the harmfulest harm! 

And whatever harm the world-maligners may do, the harm 
of the good is the harmfulest harm! 

O my brethren, into the hearts of the good and just looked 
some one once on a time, who said: "They are the Pharisees." 
BuLpeople did not understand him. 

\The good and just themselves were not free to understand 
him; their spirit was imprisoned in their good conscience. The 
stupidity of the good is unfathomably wise, j 



THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

It is the truth, however, that the good must be Pharisees 
they have no choice! 

The good must crucify him who deviseth his own virtue! 
That is the truth! 

The second one, however, who discovered their country - 
the country, heart and soil of the good and just, it was he 
who asked: "Whom do they hate most?" 

The creator, hate they most, him who breaketh the tables 
and old values, the breaker, him they call the law-breaker. 

For the good they cannot create; they are always the be 
ginning of the end: 

They crucify him who writeth new values on new tables, 
they sacrifice unto themselves the future they crucify the 
whole human future! 

ITie good they have always been the beginning of the 
end. 



O my brethren, have ye also understood this word? And 
what I once said of the "last man"? 

With whom lieth the greatest danger to the whole human 
future? Is it not with the good and just? 

Break up, break up, I pray you, the good and just! O my 
brethren, have ye understood also this word? 



Ye flee from me? Ye are frightened? Ye tremble at this 

word? 



OLD AND NEW TABLES 30 

O my brethren, when I enjoined you to break up the 
good, and the tables of the good, then only did I embark man 
on his high seas. 

And now only cometh unto him the great terror, the great 
outlook, the great sickness, the great nausea, the great sea 
sickness. 

False shores and false securities did the good teach you; in 
the lies of the good were ye born and bred. Everything hath 
been radically contorted and distorted by the good. 

But he who discovered the country of "man," discovered 
also the country of "man s future." Now shall ye be sailors 
for me, brave, patient! 

Keep yourselves up betimes, my brethren, learn to keep 
yourselves up! The sea stormeth: many seek to raise themselves 
again by you. 

The sea stormeth: all is in the sea. Well! Cheer up! Ye old 
seaman-hearts! 

What of fatherland! Thither striveth our helm where our 
children s land is! Thitherwards, stormier than the sea, 
stormeth our great longing!

"Why so hard!" said to the diamond one day the char 
coal; "are we then not near relatives?" 

Why so soft? O my brethren; thus do 7 ask you: are ye then 
not my brethren? 

Why so soft, so submissive and yielding? Why is there so 
much negation and abnegation in your hearts? Why is there 
so little fate in your looks? 



240 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

And if ye will not be fates and inexorable ones, how can 
ye one day conquer with me? 

And if your hardness will not glance and cut and chip to 
pieces, how can ye one day create with me? 

For the creators are hard. And blessedness must it seem to 
you to press your hand upon millenniums as upon wax, 

Blessedness to write upon the will of millenniums as 
upon brass, harder than brass, nobler than brass. Entirely 
hard is only the noblest. 

This new table, O my brethren, put I up over you: Become 
hard!

O thou, my Will! Thou change of every need, my needful 
ness! Preserve me from all small victories! 

Thou fatedness of my soul, which I call fate! Thou In-me! 
Over-me! Preserve and spare me for one great fate! 

And thy last greatness, my Will, spare it for thy last that 
thou mayest be inexorable in thy victory! Ah. who hath not 
succumbed to his victory ! 

Ah, whose eye hath not bedimmed in this intoxicated twi 
light! Ah, whose foot hath not faltered and forgotten in vic 
tory how to stand! 

That I may one day be ready and ripe in the great noon 
tide: ready and ripe like the glowing ore, the lightning-bearing 
cloud, and the swelling milk-udder: 

Ready for myself and for my most hidden Will: a bow 
eager for its arrow, an arrow eager for its star: 

A star, ready and ripe in its noontide, glowing, pierced, 
blessed by annihilating sun-arrows: 



THE CONVALESCENT 241 

A sun itself, and an inexorable sun-will, ready for anni 
hilation in victory! 

O Will, thou change of every need, my needfulness! Spare 
me for one great victory! 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



. The Convalescent 



ONE morning, not long after his return to his cave, Zara^ 
thustra sprang up from his couch like a madman, crying with a 
frightful voice, and acting as if some one still lay on the couch 
who did not wish to rise. Zarathustra s voice also resounded 
in such a manner that his animals came to him frightened, and 
out of all the neighbouring caves and lurking-places all the 
creatures slipped away flying, fluttering, creeping or leaping, 
according to their variety of foot or wing. Zarathustra, how 
ever, spake these words : 

Up, abysmal thought out of my depth! I am thy cock and 
morning dawn, thou overslept reptile: Up! Up! My voice shall 
soon crow thee awake! 

Unbind the fetters of thine ears: listen! For I wish to hear 
thee! Up! Up! There is thunder enough to make the very graves 
listen! 

And rub the sleep and all the dimness and blindness out of 



242 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

thine eyes! Hear me also with thine eyes: my voice is a medi 
cine even for those born blind. 

And once thou art awake, then shalt thou ever remain awake. 
It is not my custom to awake great-grandmothers out of their 
sleep that I may bid them sleep on! 

Thou stirrest, stretchiest thyself, wheezest? Up! Up! Not 
wheeze, shalt thou, but speak unto me! Zarathustra calieth 
thee, Zarathustra the godless! 

I, Zarathustra, the advocate of living, the advocate of suffer 
ing, the advocate of the circuit thee do I call, my most 
abysmal thought! 

Joy to me! Thou comest, I hear thee! Mine abyss speaketh, 
my lowest depth have I turned over into the light! 

Joy to me! Come hither! Give me thy hand ha! let be! 
aha! Disgust, disgust, disgust alas to me! 



Hardly, however, had Zarathustra spoken these words, 
when he fell down as one dead, and remained long as one 
dead. When however he again came to himself, then was he 
pale and trembling, and remained lying; and for long he 
would neither eat nor drink. This condition continued for 
seven days; his animals, however, did not leave him day nor 
night, except that the eagle flew forth to fetch food. And what 
it fetched and foraged, it laid on Zarathustra s couch: so that 
Zarathustra at last lay among yellow and red berries, grapes, 
rosy apples, sweet-smelling herbage, and pine-cones. At his 
feet, however, two lambs were stretched, which the eagle had 
with difficulty carried off from their shepherds. 

At last, after seven days, Zarathustra raised himself upon his 



THE CONVALESCENT 243 

couch, took a rosy apple in his hand, smelt it and found its 
smell pleasant. Then did his animals think the time had come 
to speak unto him. 

"O Zarathustra," said they, "now hast thou lain thus for 
seven days with heavy eyes: wilt thou not set thyself again 
upon thy feet? 

Step out of thy cave: the world waiteth for thee as a garden. 
The wind playeth with heavy fragrance which seeketh for 
thee; and all brooks would like to run after thee. 

All things long for thee, since thou hast remained alone f o)- 
seven days step forth out of thy cave! All things want to be 
thy physicians! 

Did perhaps a new knowledge come to thee, a bitter, 
grievous knowledge? Like leavened dough layest thou, thy soul 
arose and swelled beyond all its bounds. " 

O mine animals, answered Zarathustra, talk on thus and 
let me listen! It refresheth me so to hear your talk: where there 
is talk, there is the world as a garden unto me. 

How charming it is that there are words and tones; are not 
words and tones rainbows and seeming bridges twixt the 
eternally separated? 

To each soul belongeth another world; to each soul is every 
other soul a back- world. 

Among the most alike doth semblance deceive most de 
lightfully: for the smallest gap is most difficult to bridge over. 

For me how could there be an outside-of-me? There is nc 
outside! But this we forget on hearing tones; how delightful 
it is that we forget! 

Have not names and tones been given unto things that mar 
may refresh himself with them? It is a beautiful folly, speak 
ing; therewith danceth man over everything. 



244 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

How lovely is all speech and all falsehoods oJ //*,&lt;&&. Witb 
lones danceth our love on variegated rainbows. - 

"O Zarathustra," said then his animals, "to those who 
think like us, things all dance themselves : they come and hold 
out the hand and laugh and flee and return. 

Everything goeth, everything returneth; eternally rolleth the 
wheel of existence. Everything dieth, everything blossometh 
forth again; eternally runneth on the yetr of existence. 

Everything breaketh, everything is integrated anew; eter 
nally buildeth itself the same house of existence. All things 
separate, all things again greet one another; eternally true to 
itself remaineth the ring of existence. 

Every moment beginneth existence, around every Here 
rolleth the ball There. The middle is everywhere. Crooked 
is the path of eternity." 

O ye wags and barrel-organs! answered Zarathustra, and 
smiled once more, how well do ye know what had to be ful- 
fiJled in seven days: 

And how that monster crept into my throat and choked 
me! But I bit off its head and spat it away from me. 

And ye ye have made a lyre-lay out of it? Now, however, 
do I lie here, still exhausted with that biting and spitting- 
away, still sick with mine own salvation. 

And ye looked on at it all? O mine animals, are ye also cruel? 
Did ye like to look at my great pain as men do? For man is the 
cruellest animal. 

At tragedies, bull-fights, and crucifixions hath he hitherto 
been happiest on earth; and when he invented his hell, behold, 
that was his heaven on earth. 

When the great man crieth : immediately runneth the 
little man thither, and his tongue hangeth out of his mouth 
tor very lusting. He, however, calleth it his "pity." 



THE CONVALESCENT 245 

little man, especially the poet how passionately doth 
he accuse life an words! Hearken to him, but do not fail to hear 
the delight which is in all accusation! 

Such accusers of life them life overcometh with a glance of 
the eye. "Thou lovest me?" saith the insolent one; "wait a 
Uttie, as yet have I no time for thee." 

Towards himself man is the cruellest animal; and in all who 
call themselves "sinners" and "bearers of the cross" and 
"penitents," do not overlook the voluptuousness in their 
plaints and accusations! 

And I myself do. I thereby want to be man s accuser? Ah, 
mine animals, this only have I learned hitherto, that for rnan 
his baddest is necessary for his best, - 

That all that is baddest is the best power, and the hardest 
stone for the highest creator; and that man must become 
better and badder: 

Not to this torture-stake was I tied, that I know man is bad, 
but I cried, as no one hath yet cried: 

"Ah, tha : his baddest is so very small! Ah, that his best is so 
very small!" 

The great disgust at man it strangled me and had crept 
into my throat: and what the soothsayer had presaged: "All is 
alike, nothing is worth while, knowledge strangleth." 

A long twilight limped on before me, a fatally weary, 
fatally intoxicated sadness, which spake with yawning mouth. 

"Eternally he returneth, the man of whom thou art weary, 
the small man" so yawned my sadness, and dragged its foot 
and could not go to sleep. 

A cavern, became the human earth to me; its breast caved in; 
everything living became to me human dust and bones and 
mouldering past. 

My sighing sat on all human graves, and could no longer 



1^6 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

mse: my sighing and questioning croaked and choked, 
gnawed and nagged day and night: 

"Ah, man returneth eternally! The small man returner* 
eternally!" 

Naked had I once seen both of them, the greatest man anc 
the smallest man: all too like one another all too human 
even the greatest man! 

All too small, even the greatest man! that was my disgus? 
it man! And the eternal return also of the smallest man! that 
was my disgust at all existence! 

Ah, Disgust! Disgust! Disgust! Thus spake Zarathus- 

tra, and sighed and shuddered; for he remembered his sick 
ness. Then did his animals prevent him from speaking further 

"Do not speak further, thou convalescent!" so answered 
his animals, "but go out where the world waiteth for thee like 
a garden. 

Go out unto the roses, the bees, and the flocks of doves! 
Especially, however, unto the singing-birds, to learn singing 
from them! 

For singing is for the convalescent; the sound ones may talk. 
And when the sound also want songs, then want they other 
c&gt;ongs than the convalescent." 

"O ye wags and barrel-organs, do be silent!" answered 
Zarathustra, and smiled at his animals. "How well ye know 
what consolation I devised for myself in seven days! 

That I have to sing once more that consolation did I de 
vise for myself, and this convalescence: would ye also make 
another lyre-lay thereof?" 

-"Do not talk further," answered his animals once more; 
"rather, thou convalescent, prepare for thyself first a lyre, a 
new lyre! 



THE CONVALESCENT 247 

For behold, O Zarathustra! For thy new lays there are 
needed new lyres. 

Sing and bubble over, O Zarathustra, heal thy soul with ne\v 
! ays : that thou mayest bear thy great fate, which hath not yet 
been any one s fate! 

For thine animals know it well, O Zarathustra, who thou 
art and must become: behold, thou art the teacher of the 
eternal return,- that is now thy fate! 

That thou must be the first to teach this teaching how 
could this great fate not be thy greatest danger and infirmity! 

Behold, we know what thou teachest: that all things eter 
nally return, and ourselves with them, and that we have already 
existed times without number, and all things with us. 

Thou teachest that there is a great year of Becoming, a 
prodigy of a great year; it must, like a sand-glass, ever turn up 
anew, that it may anew run down and run out: 

So that all those years are like one another in the greatest 
and also in the smallest, so that we ourselves, in every great 
year, are like ourselves in the greatest and also in the smallest. 

And if thou wouldst now die, O Zarathustra, behold, we 
know also how thou wouldst then speak to thyself: but thine 
animals beseech thee not to die yet! 

Thou wouldst speak, and without trembling, buoyant rather 
with bliss, for a great weight and worry would be taken from 
thee, thou patientest one! 

Now do I die and disappear, wouldst thou say, and in a 
moment I am nothing. Souls are as mortal as bodies. 

But the plexus of causes returneth in which I am inter 
twined, it will again create me! I myself pertain to the cause? 
ot the eternal return. 

I come again with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, 



248 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

with this serpent not to a new life, or a better life, or a similar 
life: 

---I Tome again eternally to this identical and selfsame life, 
in its greatest and its smallest, to teach again the eternal return 
of dl things, 

To speak again the word of the great noontide of earth 
and man, to announce again to man the Superman. 

I have spoken my word. I break down by my word: so 
willeth mine eternal fate as announcer do I succumb! 

The hour hath now come for the down-goer to bless himself . 
Thus endeth Zarathustra s down-going. 

When the animals had spoken these words they were silent 
and waited, so that Zarathustra might say something to them ; 
but Zarathustra did not hear that they were silent. On the con 
trary, he lay quietly with closed eyes like a person sleeping, 
although he did not sleep; for he communed just then with his 
soul. The serpent, however, and the eagle, when they found 
him silent in such wise, respected the great stillness around 
him, and prudently retired. 



. The Great Longing 



O MY soul, I have taught thee to say "today" as "once on a 
time" and "formerly," and to dance thy measure over every 
Here and There and Yonder. 

O my soul, I delivered thee from all by-places, I brushed 
down from thee dust and spiders and twilight. 

O my soul, I washed the petty shame and the by-place virtue 



THE GREAT LONGING 249 

from thee, and persuaded thee to stand naked before the eyes 
uf the sun. 

With the storm that is called "spirit" did I blow over thy 
surging sea; all clouds did I blow away from it; I strangled even 
the strangler called "sin." 

O my soul, I gave thee the right to say Nay like the storm, 
and to say Yea as the open heaven saith Yea: calm as the light 
remainest thou, and now walkest through denying storms. 

O my soul, I restored to thee liberty over the created and the 
uncreated; and who knoweth. as thou knowest, the voluptuous 
ness of the future? 

O my soul, I taught thee the contempt which doth not come 
like worm-eating, the great, the loving contempt, which loveth 
most where it contemneth most. 

O my soul, I taught thee so to persuade that thou persuadest 
even the grounds themselves to thee : like the sun, which per- 
suadeth even the sea to its height. 

O my soul, I have taken from thee all obeying and knee* 
bending and homage-paying; I have myself given thee the 
names, "Change of need" and "Fate." 

O my soul, I have given thee new names and gay-coloured 
playthings, I have called thee "Fate" and "the Circuit of cir 
cuits" and "the Navel-string of time" and "the Azure bell." 

O my soul, to thy domain gave I all wisdom to drink all new 
wines, and also all immemorially old strong wines of wisdom. 

O my soul, every sun shed I upon thee, and every night and 
every silence and every longing: then grewest thou up for 
me as a vine. 

O my soul, exuberant and heavy dost thou now stand forth, 
a vine with swelling udders and full clusters of brown golden 
grapes: 



2^0 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Filled and weighted by thy happiness, waiting from 
superabundance, and yet ashamed of thy waiting. 

O my soul, there is nowhere a soul which could be more 
loving and more comprehensive and more extensive! Where 
could future and past be closer together than with thee? 

O my soul, I have given thee everything, and all my hands 
have become empty by thee: and now! Now sayest thou to 
me, smiling and full of melancholy: "Which of us oweth 
thanks? 

Doth the giver not owe thanks because the receiver re 
ceived? Is bestowing not a necessity? Is receiving not pity 
ing?" 

O my soul, I understand the smiling of thy melancholy: 
thine over-abundance itself now stretcheth out longing hands! 

Thy fulness looketh forth over raging seas, and seeketh and 
waiteth: the longing of over-fulness looketh forth from the 
smiling heaven of thine eyes! 

And verily, O my suul! Who could see thy smiling and not 
melt into tears? The angels themselves melt into tears through 
the over-graciousness of thy smiling. 

Thy graciousness and over-graciousness, is it which will not 
complain and weep: and yet, O my soul, longeth thy smiling 
for tears, and thy trembling mouth for sobs. 

"Is not all weeping complaining? And all complaining, ac 
cusing?" Thus speakest thou to thyself; and therefore, O my 
soul, wilt thou rather smile than pour forth thy grief 

Than in gushing tears pour forth all thy grief concerning 
thy fulness, and concerning the craving of the vine for the 
vintager and vintage-knife! 

But wilt thou not weep, wilt thou not weep forth thy purple 
melancholy, then wilt thou have to sing, O my soul! Behold- 
T smile myself, who foretell thee this: 



THE GREAT LONGING 251 

Thou wilt have to sing with passionate song, until all seas 
turn calm to hearken unto thy longing, 

Until over calm longing seas the bark giideth, the golden 
marvel, around the gold of which all good, bad, and marvel 
lous things frisk: 

Also many large and small animals, and everything that 
hath light marvellous feet, so that it can run on violet-blue 
paths, 

Towards the golden marvel, the spontaneous bark, and its 
master: he, however, is the vintager who waiteth with the 
diamond vintage-knife, 

Thy great deliverer, O my soul, the nameless one 
-for whom future songs only will find names! And verily, 
already hath thy breath the fragrance of future songs, 

Already glowest thou and dreamest, already drinkest thou 
thirstily at all deep echoing wells of consolation, already re- 
poseth thy melancholy in the bliss of future songs! 

O my soul, now have I given thee all, and even my last 
possession, and all my hands have become empty by thee: 
that I bade thee sing, behold, that was my last thing to give! 

That I bade thee sing, say now, say: which of us now 
oweth thanks? Better still, however: sing unto me, sing, O 
aiy soul! And let me thank thee! 

Thus spake Zarathustra.

59. The Second Dance Song 



"INTO thine eyes gazed I lately, O Life: gold saw I gleam in 
chy night-eyes, my heart stood still with delight: 

A golden bark saw I gleam on darkened waters, a sinking, 
drinking, reblinking, golden swing-bark! 

At my dance-frantic foot, dost thou cast a glance, a laughing, 
questioning, melting, thrown glance: 

Twice only movedst thou thy rattle with thy little hands 
then did my feet swing with dance-fury. 

My heels reared aloft, my toes they hearkened, thee they 
would know : hath not the dancer his ear in his toe! 

Unto thee did I spring: then fledst thou back from my 
bound; and towards me waved thy fleeing, flying tresses round! 

Away from thee did I spring, and from tiiy snaky tresses: 
then stoodst thou there half -turned, and in thine eye caresses. 

With crooked glances dost thou teach me crooked courses; 
on crooked courses learn my feet crafty fancies! 

I fear thee near, I love thee far; thy flight allureth me, thy 
seeking secureth me: I suffer, but for thee, what would I not 
gladly bear! 

For thee, whose coldness inflameth, whose hatred mislead- 
eth, whose flight enchaineth, whose mockery pleadeth : 

Who would not hate thee, thou great bindress, in- 
windress, temptress, seekress, fmdress! Who would not love 
thee, thou innocent, impatient, wind-swift, child-eyed sinner! 

Whither pullest thou me now, thou paragon and tomboy? 
And now foolest thou me fleeing; thou sweet romp dost annoy! 



THE SECOND DANCE SONG 

I dance after thee, I follow even faint traces lonely. Where 
art thou? Give me thy hand! Or thy finger only! 

Here are caves and thickets: we shall go astray! Halt! 
Stand still! Seest thou not owls and bats in fluttering fray? 

Thou bat! Thou owl! Thou wouldst play me foul? Where 
are we? From the dogs hast thou learned thus to bark and howl. 

Thou gnashest on me sweetly with little white teeth; thine 
evil eyes shoot out upon me, thy curly little mane from under 
neath! 

This is a dance over stock and stone: I am the hunter, wilt 
thou be my hound, or my chamois anon? 

Now beside me! And quickly, wickedly springing! Now up? 
And over! Alas! I have fallen myself overswinging! 

Oh, see me lying, thou arrogant one, and imploring grace; 
Gladly would I walk with thee in some lovelier place! 

In the paths of love, through bushes variegated, quiet, 
trim! Or there along the lake, where gold-fishes dance and 
swim! 

Thou art now a- weary? There above are sheep and sun-set 
stripes: is it not sweet to sleep the shepherd pipes? 

Thou art so very weary? I carry thee thither; let just thine 
arm sink! And art thou thirsty I should have something; but 
thy mouth would not like it to drink! 

Oh, that cursed, nimble, supple serpent and lurking- 
witch! Where art thou gone? But in my face do I feel through 
thy hand, two spots and red blotches itch! 

I am verily weary of it, ever thy sheepish shepherd to be 
Thou witch, if I have hitherto *ung unto thee, now shalt thou 
cry unto me! 

To the rhythm of my whip shalt thou dance and ay! 1 for 
get not my whip? Not I. 1 "- 



254 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 



Then did Life answer me thus, and kept thereby her fine ears 
closed : 

"O Zarathustra! Crack not so terribly with thy whip! Thou 
knowest surely that noise killeth thought, and just now 
there came to me such delicate thoughts. 

We are both of us genuine ne er-do-wells and ne er-do-ills. 
Beyond good and evil found we our island and our green 
meadow we two alone! Therefore must we be friendly to 
each other! 

And even should we not love each other from the bottom of 
our hearts, must we then have a grudge against each other if 
we do not love each other perfectly? 

And that I am friendly to thee, and often too friendly, that 
knowest thou: and the reason is that I am envious of thy Wis 
dom. Ah, this mad old fool, Wisdom! 

If thy Wisdom should one day run away from thee, ah! then 
would also my love run away from thee quickly." 

Thereupon did Life look thoughtfully behind and around, 
and said softly: "O Zarathustra, thou art not faithful enough 
to me! 

Thou lovest me not nearly so much as thou sayest; I know 
thou thinkest of soon leaving me. 

There is an old heavy, heavy, booming-clock : it boometh by 
night up to tfiv cave: 

When thou hearest this clock strike the hours at midnight, 
then thinkest thou between one and twelve thereon 

-Thou thinkest thereon, O Zarathustra, J know it of soon 
leaving me!" 



THE SECOND DANCE SONG 25$ 

"Yea,* 1 answered I, hesitatingly, "but thou knowest it also 
And I said something into her ear, in amongst her confused, 
yellow, foolish tresses. 

"Thou knowest that, O Zarathustra? That knoweth no 
one " 

And we gazed at each other, and looked at the green 
meadow o er which the cool evening was just passing, and we 
wept together. Then, however, was Life dearer unto m 
all my Wisdom had ever been. 

Thus spake Zarathustra.

FOURTH AND LAST PART 



Ah, where in the world have there 
been greater follies than with the piti 
ful? And what in the world hath 
caused more suffering than the follies 
of the pitiful ? 

Woe unto all loving ones who have 
not an elevation which is above their 
pity! 

Thus spake the devil unto me, once 
on a time: "Ever God hath his hell: 
it is his love for man." 

And lately did I hear him say these 
words- "God is dead: of his pity for 
man hath God died." ZARATHUSTRA,

Cr, The Honey Sacrifice 



again passed moons and years over Zarathustra s soul, 
and he heeded it not; his hair, however, became white. One 
day when he sat on a stone in front of his cave, and gazed 
calmly into the distance one there gazeth out on the sea, and 
away beyond sinuous abysses, then went his animals thought 
fully round about him, and at last set themselves in front of 
him. 

"O Zarathustra," said they, "gazest thou out perhaps for thy 
happiness?" "Of what account is my happiness!" answered 
he, "I have long ceased to strive any more for happiness, I 
strive for my work." "O Zarathustra," said the animals once 
more, "that sayest thou as one who hath overmuch of good 
things. Liest thou not in a sky-blue lake of happiness?"- -"Ye 
wags," answered Zarathustra, and smiled, "how well did ye 
choose the simile! But ye know also that my happiness is heavy, 
and not like a fluid wave of water : it presseth me and will not 
leave me, and is like molten pitch. "- 

Then went his animals again thoughtfully around him, and 
placed themselves once more in front of him. "O Zarathustra," 
said they, "it is consequently for that reason that thou thy 
self always becometh yellower and darker, although thy hair 
looketh white and flaxen? Lo, thou sittest in thy pitch! "- 
"What do ye say, mine animals?" said Zarathustra, laughing; 
"verily I reviled when I spake of pitch. As it happeneth with 





264 THUS SPAKE ZARATHflSTRA 

me, so is it with all fruits that turn ripe. It is the honey in my 
veins that maketh my blood thicker, and also my soul .stiller." 
"So will it be, O Zarathustra," answered his animals, and 
pressed up to him; "but wilt thou not today ascend a high 
mountain? The air is pure, and today one seeth more of the 
world than ever."- -"Yea, mine animals," answered he, "ye 
counsel admirably and according to rny heart: I will today 
ascend a high mountain! But see that honey is then ready to 
hand, yellow, white, good, ice-cool, golden-comb-honey. For 
know that when aloft I will make the honey-sacrifice. "- 

When Zarathustra, however, was aloft on the summit, he 
sent his animals home that had accompanied him, and found 
that he was now alone: then he laughed from the bottom of 
his heart, looked around him, and spake thus: 

That I spake of sacrifices and honey-sacrifices, it was merely 
a ruse in talking and verily, a useful folly! Here aloft can I 
now speak freer than in front of mountain-caves and ancho 
rites domestic animals. 

What to sacrifice! I squander what is given me, a squan 
derer with a thousand hands: how could I call that sacri 
ficing? 

And when I desired honey I only desired bait, and sweet 
mucus and mucilage, for which even the mouths of growling 
bears, and strange, sulky, evil birds, water: 

The best bait, as huntsmen and fishermen require it. For 
if the world be as a gloomy forest of animals, and a pleasure- 
ground for all wild huntsmen, it seemeth to me rather and 
preferably a fathomless, rich sea; 

A sea full of many-hued fishes and crabs, for which even 
the gods might long, and might be tempted to become fishers 



THE HONEY SACRIFICE 265 

in it, and casters of nets, so rich is the world in wonderful 
things, great and small! 

Especially the human world, the human sea: towards // 
do I now throw out my golden angle-rod and say: Open up, 
thou human abyss! 

Open up, and throw unto me thy fish and shining crabs! 
With my best bait shall I allure to myself today the strangest 
human fish! 

My happiness itself do I throw out into all places far 
and wide twixt orient, noontide, and Occident, to see if many 
human fish will not learn to hug and rug at my happiness; 

Until, biting at my sharp hidden hooks, they have to come 
up unto my height, the motleyest abyss-groundlings, to the 
wickedest of all fishers of men. 

For this am I from the heart and from the beginning 
drawing, hither-drawing, upward-drawing, upbringing; a 
drawer, a trainer, a training-master, who not in vain coun 
selled himself once on a time: "Become what thou art!" 

Thus may men now come up to me; for as yet do I await 
the signs that it is time for my down-going; as yet do I not 
myself go down, as I must do, amongst men. 

Therefore do I here wait, crafty and scornful upon high 
mountains, no impatient one, no patient one; rather one 
who hath even unlearnt patience, because he no longer 
" suffer eth," 

For my fate giveth me time: it hath forgotten me perhaps? 
Or doth it sit behind a big stone and catch flies? 

And verily, I am well-disposed to mine eternal fate, be 
cause it doth not hound and hurry me, but leaveth me time 
for merriment and mischief; so that I have to-day ascended this 
high mountain to catch fish. 



266 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Did ever any one catch fish upon high mountains? And 
though it be a folly what I here seek and do, it is better so than 
that down below I should become solemn with waiting, and 
green and yellow 

A posturing wrath-snorter with waiting, a holy howl- 
storm from the mountains, an impatient one that shouteth 
down into the valleys: "Hearken, else I will scourge you with 
the scourge of God!" 

Not that I would have a grudge against such wrathful ones 
on that account: they are well enough for laughter to me! 
Impatient must they now be, those big alarm-drums, which 
find a voice now or never! 

Myself, however, and my fate we do not talk to the 
Present, neither do we talk to the Never: for talking we have 
patience and time and more than time. For one day must it yet 
come, and may not pass by. 

What must one day come and may not pass by? Our great 
Hazar, that is to say, our great, remote human-kingdom, the 
Zarathustra-kingdom of a thousand years 

How remote may such "remoteness" be? What doth it 
concern me? But on that account it is none the less sure unto 
me , with both feet stand I secure on this ground; 

On an eternal ground, on hard primary rock, on this 
highest, hardest, primary mountain-ridge, unto which all 
winds come, as unto the storm-parting, asking Where? and 
Whence? and Whither? 

Here laugh, laugh, my hearty, healthy wickedness! From 
high mountains cast down thy glittering scorn-laughter! 
Allure for me with thy glittering the finest human fish! 

And whatever belongeth unto me in all seas, my in-and- 
f or-me in all things fish that out for me, bring that up to me: 
for that do I wait, the wickedest of all fish-catchers. 



THE CRY OF DISTRESS 267 

Out! out! my fishing-hook! In and down, thou bait of my 
happiness! Drip thy sweetest dew, thou honey of my heart! 
Bite, my fishing-hook, into the belly of all black affliction! 

Look out, look out, mine eye! Oh, how many seas round 
about me, what dawning human futures! And above me 
what rosy red stillness! What unclouded silence! 



62. The Cry of Distress 

THE next day sat Zarathustra again on the stone in front of 
his cave, whilst his animals roved about in the world outside 
to bring home new food, also new honey: for Zarathustra 
had spent and wasted the old honey to the very last particle. 
When he thus sat, however, with a stick in his hand, tracing 
the shadow of his figure on the earth, and reflecting verily! 
not upon himself and his shadow, all at once he startled and 
shrank back: for he saw another shadow beside his own. And 
when he hastily looked around and stood up, behold, there 
stood the soothsayer beside him, the same whom he had once 
given to eat and drink at his table, the proclaimer of the great 
weariness, who taught: "All is alike, nothing is worth while, 
the world is without meaning, knowledge strangleth." But 
his face had changed since then; and when Zarathustra looked 
into his eyes, his heart was startled once more: so much evil 
announcement and ashy-grey lightnings passed over that coun 
tenance. 

The soothsayer, who had perceived what went on in Zara- 
thustra s soul, wiped his face with his hand, as if he would 
wipe out the impression; the same did also Zarathustra. And 



268 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

when both of them had thus silently composed and strength 
ened themselves, they gave each other the hand, as a token 
that they wanted once more to recognise each other. 

"Welcome hither," said Zarathustra, "thou soothsayer of 
the great weariness, not in vain shalt thou once have been my 
messmate and guest. Eat and drink also with me to-day, and 
forgive it that a cheerful old man sitteth with thee at table!" 
"A cheerful old man?" answered the soothsayer, shaking his 
head, "but whoever thou art, or wouldst be, O Zarathustra, 
thou hast been here aloft the longest time, in a little while 
thy bark shall no longer rest on dry land!"- -"Do 1 then rest 
on dry land?" asked Zarathustra, laughing. "The waves 
around thy mountain," answered the soothsayer, "rise and 
rise, the waves of great distress and affliction: they will soon 
raise thy bark also and carry thee away." Thereupon was 
Zarathustra silent and wondered. "Dost thou still hear 
nothing?" continued the soothsayer: "doth it not rush and 
roar out of the depth?" Zarathustra was silent once more and 
listened: then heard he a long, long cry, which the abysses 
threw to one another and passed on; for none of them wished 
to retain it: so evil did it sound. 

"Thou ill announcer," said Zarathustra at last, "that is a cry 
of distress, and the cry of a man; it may come perhaps out of 
a black sea. But what doth human distress matter to me! My last 
sin which hath been reserved for me, knowest thou what it is 
called?" 

Pity!" answered the soothsayer from an overflowing 
heart, and raised both his hands aloft "O Zarathustra, I have 
come that I may seduce thee to thy last sin!" 

And hardly had those words been uttered when there 
sounded the cry once more, and longer and more alarming 



THE CRY OF DISTRESS 269 

than before also much nearer. "Hearest thou? Hearest thou, 
O Zarathustra?" called out the soothsayer, "the cry concerneth 
tnee, it calleth thee: Come, come, come; it is time, it is the 
highest time!" 

Zarathustra was silent thereupon, confused and staggered; 
at last he asked, like one who hesitateth in himself: "And who 
is it that there calleth me?" 

"But thou knowest it, certainly," answered the soothsayer 
warmly, "why dost thou conceal thyself? It is the higher man 
that crieth for thee!" 

"The higher man?" cried Zarathustra, horror-stricken: 
"what wanteth he? What wanteth he? The higher man! What 
wanteth he here?" and his skin covered with perspiration. 

The soothsayer, however, did not heed Zarathustra s alarm, 
but listened and listened in the downward direction. When, 
however, it had been still there for a long while, he looked 
behind, and saw Zarathustra standing trembling. 

"O Zarathustra," he began, with sorrowful voice, "thou dost 
not stand there like one whose happiness maketh him giddy: 
thou wilt have to dance lest thou tumble down! 

But although thou shouldst dance before me, and leap all thy 
side-leaps, no one may say unto me: Behold, here danceth the 
last joyous man! 

In vain would any one come to this height who sought him 
here: caves would he find, indeed, and back-caves, hiding- 
places for hidden ones; but not lucky mines, nor treasure* 
chambers, nor new gold-veins of happiness. 

Happiness how indeed could one find happiness among 
such buried-alive and solitary ones! Must I yet seek the last 
happiness on the Happy Isles, and far away among forgotten 
seas? 



270 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

But all is alike, nothing is worth while, no seeking is of 
service, there are no longer any Happy Isies! ;? 

Thus sighed the soothsayer; with his last sigh, however, 
Zarathustra again became serene and assured, like one who 
hath come out of a deep chasm into the light. "Nay! Nay! 
Three times Nay!" exclaimed he with a strong voice, and 
stroked his beard "that do I know better! There are still 
Happy Isles! Silence thereon, thou sighing sorrow-sack! 

Cease to splash thereon, thou rain-cloud of the forenoon! 
Do I not already stand here wet with thy misery, and drenched 
like a dog? 

Now do I shake myself and run away from thee, that I may 
again become dry: thereat mayest thou not wonder! Do I seem 
to thee discourteous? Here however is my court. 

But as regards the higher man: well! I shall seek him at 
once in those forests: from thence came his cry. Perhaps he is 
there hard beset by an evil beast. 

He is in my domain: therein shall he receive no scath! And 
verily, there are many evil beasts about me." 

With those words Zarathustra turned around to depart. 
Then said the soothsayer: "O Zarathustra, thou art a rogue! 

I know it well: thou wouldst fain be rid of me! Rather 
wouldst thou run into the forest and lay snares for evil beasts! 

But what good will it do thee? In the evening wilt thou have 
me again: in thine own cave will I sit, patient and heavy like a 
block and wait for thee!" 

"So be it!" shouted back Zarathustra, as he went away: "and 
what is mine in my cave belongeth also unto thee. my guest! 

Shouldst thou however find honey therein, well! just lick it 
up, thou growling bear, and sweeten thy soul! For in the eve 
ning we want both to be in good spirits; 



TALK WITH THE KINGS 271 

In good spirits and joyful, because this day hath come to 
an end! And thou thyself shalt dance to my lays, as my dancing- 
bear. 

Thou dost not believe this? Thou shakest thy head? Well! 
Cheer up, old bear! But I also am a soothsayer." 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



65. Talk with the Kings 



ERE Zarathustra had been an hour on his way in the moun 
tains and forests, he saw all at once a strange procession. Right 
on the path which he was about to descend came two kings 
walking, bedecked with crowns and purple girdles, and varie 
gated like flamingoes: they drove before them a laden ass. 
"What do these kings want in my domain?" said Zarathustra 
in astonishment to his heart, and hid himself hastily behind a 
thicket. When however the kings approached to him, he said 
half -aloud, like one speaking only to himself: "Strange! 
Strange! How doth this harmonise? Two kings do I see and 
only one ass!" 

Thereupon the two kings made a halt; they smiled and 
looked towards the spot whence the voice proceeded, and 
afterwards looked into each other s faces. "Such things do we 
also think among ourselves," said the king on the right, "but 
we do not utter them." 

The king on the left, however, shrugged his shoulders and 



272 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

answered: "That may perhaps be a goat-herd. Or an anchorite 
who hath lived too long among rocks and trees. For no society 
at all spoileth also good manners." 

"Good manners?" replied angrily and bitterly the other 
king: "what then do we run out of the way of? Is it not good 
manners ? Our good society ? 

Better, verily, to live among anchorites and goat-herds, than 
with our gilded, false, over-rouged populace though it call 
itself good society. 

Though it call itself nobility. But there all is false and 
foul, above all the blood thanks to old evil diseases and 
worse curers. 

The best and dearest to me at present is still a sound peasant, 
coarse, artful, obstinate and enduring: that is at present the 
noblest type. 

The peasant is at present the best; and the peasant type 
should be master! But it is the kingdom of the populace I no 
longer allow anything to be imposed upon me. The populace, 
however that meaneth, hodgepodge. 

Populace-hodgepodge: therein is everything mixed with 
everything, saint and swindler, gentleman and Jew, and every 
beast out of Noah s ark. 

Good manners! Everything is false and foul with us. No 
one knoweth any longer how to reverence: it is that precisely 
that we run away from. They are fulsome obtrusive dogs; they 
gild palm-leaves. 

This loathing choketh me, that we kings ourselves have be 
come false, draped and disguised with the old faded pomp of 
our ancestors, show-pieces for the stupidest, the craftiest, and 
whosoever at present trafficketh for power. 

We are not the first men and have nevertheless to stand for 



TALK WITH THE KINGS 273 

them: of this imposture have we at last become weary and 
disgusted. 

From the rabble have we gone out of the way, from all those 
bawlers and scribe-blowflies, from the trader-stench, the ambi 
tion-fidgeting, the bad breath : fie, to live among the rabble; 

Fie, to stand for the first men among the rabble! Ah, 
loathing! Loathing! Loathing! What doth it now matter about 
us kings!" 

"Thine old sickness seizeth thee," said here the king on the 
left, "thy loathing seizeth thee, my poor brother. Thou 
knowest, however, that some one heareth us." 

Immediately thereupon, Zarathustra, who had opened ears 
and eyes to this talk, rose from his hiding-place, advanced 
towards the kings, and thus began: 

"He who hearkeneth unto you, he who gladly hearkeneth 
unto you, is called Zarathustra. 

I am Zarathustra who once said : What doth it now matter 
about kings! Forgive me; I rejoiced when ye said to each 
other: What doth it matter about us kings! 

Here, however, is my domain and jurisdiction: what may ye 
be seeking in my domain? Perhaps, however, ye have found on 
your way what / seek: namely, the higher man." 

When the kings heard this, they beat upon their breasts and 
said with one voice: "We are recognised! 

With the sword of thine utterance severest thou the thickest 
darkness of our hearts. Thou hast discovered our distress; for 
lo! we are on our way to find the higher man 

The man that is higher than we, although we are kings. 
To him do we convey this ass. For the highest man shall also 
be the highest lord on earth. 

There is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny, than 
when the mighty of the earth are not also the first men. Then 



274 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

everything becometh false and distorted and monstrous. 

And when they are even the last men, and more beast than 
man, then riseth and riseth the populace in honour, and at last 
saith even the populace- virtue: Lo, I alone am virtue! " 

What have I just heard? answered Zarathustra. What wis 
dom in kings! I am enchanted, and verily, I have already 
promptings to make a rhyme thereon: 

Even if it should happen to be a rhyme not suited for 
every one s ears. I unlearned long ago to have consideration 
for long ears. Well then! Well now! 

( Here, however, it happened that the ass also found utter 
ance: it said distinctly and with malevolence, Y-E-A.) 

Twas once methinks year one of our blessed Lord, 
Drunk without wine, the Sybil thus deplored: 
"How ill things go! 

Decline! Decline! Ne er sank the world so low! 
Rome now hath turned harlot and harlot-stew, 
Rome s Caesar a beast, and God hath turned Jew!" 



With those rhymes of Zarathustra the kings were delighted; 
the king on the right, however, said: "O Zarathustra, how 
well it was that we set out to see thee! 

For thine enemies showed us thy likeness in their mirror: 
there lookedst thou with the grimace ot a devil, and sneer- 
ingly: so that we were afraid of thee. 

But what good did it do! Always didst thou prick us anew 
in heart and ear with thy sayings. Then did we say at last: 
What doth it matter how he look! 



TALK WITH THE KINGS 2/5 

We must hear him; him who teacheth: Ye shall love peace 
as a means to new wars, and the short peace more than the 
long! 

No one ever spake such warlike words: What is good? To 
be brave is good. It is the good war that halloweth every 
cause. 

O Zarathustra, our fathers blood stirred in our veins at 
such words : it was like the voice of spring to old wine-casks. 

When the swords ran among one another like red-spotted 
serpents, then did our fathers become fond of life; the sun of 
every peace seemed to them languid and lukewarm, the long 
peace, however, made them ashamed. 

How they sighed, our fathers, when they saw on the wall 
brightly furbished, dried-up swords! Like those they thirsted 
for war. For a sword thirsteth to drink blood, and sparkleth 
with desire. "- 

When the kings thus discoursed and talked eagerly of the 
happiness of their fathers, there came upon Zarathustra no 
little desire to mock at their eagerness: for evidently they were 
very peaceable kings whom he saw before him, kings with 
old and refined features. But he restrained himself. "Well!" 
said he, "thither leadeth the way, there lieth the cave of Zara 
thustra; and this day is to have a long evening! At present, 
however, a cry of distress calleth me hastily away from you. 

It will honour my cave if kings want to sit and wait in it 
but, to be sure, ye will have to wait long! 

Well! What of that! Where doth one at present learn 
better to wait than at courts? And the whole virtue of kings 
that hath remained unto them is it not called to-day: Ability 
to wait?" 

Thus spake Zarathustra,

64. The Leech 



AND Zarathustra went thoughtfully on, further and lower 
down, through forests and past moory bottoms; as it hap- 
peneth, however, to every one who meditateth upon hara 
matters, he trod thereby unawares upon a man. And lo, there 
spurted into his face all at once a cry of pain, and two curses 
and twenty bad invectives, so that in his fright he raised his 
stick and also struck the trodden one. Immediately afterwards, 
however, he regained his composure, and his heart laughed at 
the folly he had just committed. 

"Pardon me," said he to the trodden one, who had got up 
enraged, and had seated himself, "pardon me, and hear first 
of all a parable. 

As a wanderer who dreameth of remote things on a lone 
some highway, runneth unawares against a sleeping dog, a dog 
which lieth in the sun : 

As both of them then start up and snap at each other, like 
deadly enemies, those two beings mortally frightened so 
did it happen unto us. 

And yet! And yet how little was lacking for them to 
caress each other, that dog and that lonesome one! Are they 
not both lonesome ones!" 

-"Whoever thou art," said the trodden one, still enraged, 
"thou treadest also too nigh me with thy parable, and not only 
with thy foot! 

Lo! am I then a dog?" And thereupon the sitting one got 
up, and pulled his naked arm out of the swamp. For at first 
he had Jain outstretched on the ground, hidden and indis 
cernible, like those who lie in wait for swamp-game. 



THE LEECH 277 

"But whatever art thou about!" called out Zaathustra in 
alarm, for he saw a deal of blood streaming over the naked 
arm, "what hath hurt thee? Hath an evil beast bit thee 
thou unfortunate one?" 

The bleeding one laughed, still angry, "What matter is it 
to thee!" said he, and was about to go on. "Here am I at home 
and in my province. Let him question me whoever will: to a 
dolt, however, I shall hardly answer." 

"Thou art mistaken," said Zarathustra sympathetically, and 
held him fast; "thou art mistaken. Here thou art not at home, 
but in my domain, and therein shall no one receive any hurt. 

Call me however what thou wilt I am who I must be. I 
call myself Zarathustra. 

Well! Up thither is the way to Zarathustra s cave: it is not 
far, wilt thou not attend to thy wounds at my home? 

It hath gone badly with thee, thou unfortunate one, in this 
life: first a beast bit thee, and then a man trod upon 
thee!"- 

When however the trodden one had heard the name of 
Zarathustra he was transformed. "What happeneth unto me!" 
he exclaimed, "who preoccupieth me so much in this life as 
this one man, namely Zarathustra, and that one animal that 
liveth on blood, the leech? 

For the sake of the leech did I lie here by this swamp, like 
a fisher, and already had mine outstretched arm been bitten 
ten times, when there biteth a still finer leech at my blood, 
Zarathustra himself! 

O happiness! O miracle! Praised be this day which enticed 
me into the swamp! Praised be the best, the livest cupping- 
glass, that at present liveth; praised be the great conscience- 
leech Zarathustra!" 



1*78 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Thus spake the trodden one, and Zarathustra rejoiced at his 
words and their refined reverential style. "Who art thou?" 
asked he, and gave him his hand, "there is much to clear up 
and elucidate between us, but already methinketh pure clear 
day is dawning." 

"I am the spiritually conscientious one," answered he who 
was asked, "and in matters of the spirit it is difficult for any one 
to take it more rigorously, more restrictedly, and more severely 
than I, except him from whom I learnt it, Zarathustra himself. 

Better know nothing than half -know many things! Better 
be a fool on one s own account, than a sage on other people s 
approbation! I go to the basis: 

What matter if it be great or small? If it be called swamp 
or sky? A handbreadth of basis is enough for me, if it be 
actually basis and ground! 

A handbreadth of basis: thereon can one stand. In the true 
knowing-knowledge there is nothing great and nothing 
small." 

"Then thou art perhaps an expert on the leech?" asked 
Zarathustra; "and thou investigatest the leech to its ultimate 
basis, thou conscientious one?" 

"O Zarathustra," answered the trodden one, "that would be 
something immense; how could I presume to do so! 

That, however, of which I am master and knower, is the 
brain of the leech: that is my world! 

And it is also a world! Forgive it, however, that my pride 
here findeth expression, for here I have not mine equal. There 
fore said I : here am I at home. 

How long have I investigated this one thing, the brain of 
the leech, so that here the slippery truth might no longer slip 
from me! Here is my domain! 

For the sake of this did I cast everything else aside, for 



THE LEECH 279 

the sake of this did everything else become indifferent to me; 
and close beside my knowledge lieth my black ignorance. 

My spiritual conscience requireth from me that it should 
be so that I should know one thing, and not know all else: 
they are a loathing unto me, all the semi-spiritual, all the hazy, 
hovering, and visionary. 

Where mine honesty ceaseth, there am I blind, and want 
also to be blind. Where I want to know, however, there want 
I also to be honest namely, severe, rigorous, restricted, cruel 
and inexorable. 

Because thou once saidest, O Zarathustra: Spirit is life 
which itself cutteth into life ; that led and allured me to 
thy doctrine. And verily, with mine own blood have I in 
creased mine own knowledge!" 

-"As the evidence indicateth," broke in Zarathustra; for 
still was the blood flowing down on the naked arm of the 
conscientious one. For there had ten leeches bitten into it. 

"O thou strange fellow, how much doth this very evidence 
teach me namely, thou thyself! And not all, perhaps, might 
I pour into thy rigorous ear! 

Well then! We part here! But I would fain find thee again. 
Up thither is the way to my cave: to-night shalt thou there 
by my welcome guest! 

Fain would I also make amends to thy body for Zarathustra 
treading upon thee with his feet: I think about that. Just now, 
however, a cry of distress calleth me hastily away from thee/" 

Thus spaKe Zarathustra.

WHEN however Zarathustra had gone round a rock, then saw 
he on the same path, not far below him, a man who threw his 
limbs about like a maniac, and at last tumbled to the ground 
on his belly. "Halt!" said then Zarathustra to his heart, "he 
there must surely be the higher man, from him came that 
dreadful cry of distress, I will see if I can help him." When, 
however, he ran to the spot where the man lay on the ground, 
he found a trembling old man with fixed eyes; and in spite of 
all Zarathustra s efforts to lift him and set him again on his 
feet, it was all in vain. The unfortunate one, also, did not seem 
to notice that some one was beside him; on the contrary, he 
continually looked around with moving gestures, like one for 
saken and isolated from all the world. At last, however, after 
much trembling, and convulsion, and curling-himself-up, he 
began to lament thus:

Here, however, Zarathustra could no longer restrain him 
self; he took his staff and struck the wailer with all his might. 
"Stop this," cried he to him with wrathful laughter, "stop this, 
thou stage-player! Thou false coiner! Thou liar from the very 
heart! I know thee well! 

I will soon make warm legs to thee, thou evil magician: I 
know well how to make it hot for such as thou!" 

"Leave off," said the old man, and sprang up from the 
ground, "strike me no more, O Zarathustra! I did it only for 
amusement! 

That kind of thing belongeth to mine art. Thee thyself, I 
wanted to put to the proof when I gave this performance. And 
verily, thou hast well detected me! 

But thou thyself hast given me no small proof of thyself: 
thou art hard, thou wise Zarathustra! Hard strikest thou with 
thy truths, thy cudgel forceth from me this truth!" 

"Flatter not," answered Zarathustra, still excited and 
frowning, "thou stage-player from the heart! Thou art false: 
why speakest thou of truth! 



THE MAGICIAN 285 

Thou peacock of peacocks, thou sea of vanity; what didst 
thou represent before me, thou evil magician; whom was J 
meant to believe in when thou wailedst in such wise?" 

"The penitent in spirit," said the old man, "it was him 1 
represented; thou thyself once devisedst this expression 

The poet and magician who at last turneth his spirit 
against himself, the transformed one who freezeth to death 
by his bad science and conscience. 

And just acknowledge it: it was long, O Zarathustra, be 
fore thou discoveredst my trick and lie! Thou believedst in my 
distress when thou heldest my head with both thy hands, 

I heard thee lament we have loved him too little, loved 
him too little! Because I so far deceived thee, my wickedness 
rejoiced in me." 

"Thou mayest have deceived subtler ones than I," said Zara 
thustra sternly. "I am not on my guard against deceivers; I 
have to be without precaution : so willeth my lot. 

Thou, however, must deceive: so far do I know thee! Thou 
must ever be equivocal, trivocal, quadrivocal, and quinqui- 
vocal! Even what thou hast now confessed, is not nearly true 
enough nor false enough for me! 

Thou bad false coiner, how couldst thou do otherwise! Thy 
very malady wouldst thou whitewash if thou showed thyself 
naked to thy physician. 

Thus didst thou whitewash thy lie before me when thou 
saidst: T did so only for amusement! There was also serious 
ness therein, thou art something of a penitent-in-spirit! 

I divine thee well: thou hast become the enchanter of all 
the world; but for thyself thou hast no lie or artifice left, 
thou art disenchanted to thyself! 

Thou hast reaped disgust as thy one truth. No word in thee 



286 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

is any longer genuine, but thy mouth is so: that is to say, the 
disgust that cleaveth unto thy mouth." 

"Who art thou at all!" cried here the old magician with 
defiant voice, "who dareth to speak thus unto me, the greatest 
man now living?" and a green flash shot from his eye at 
Zarathustra. But immediately after he changed, and said sadly: 

"O Zarathustra, I am weary of it, I am disgusted with mine 
arts, I am not great, why do I dissemble! But thou knowest 
it well 1 sought for greatness! 

A great man I wanted to appear, and persuaded many; but 
the lie hath been beyond my power. On it do I collapse. 

O Zarathustra, everything is a lie in me; but that I collapse 
this my collapsing is genuine!" 

"It honoureth thee," said Zarathustra gloomily, looking 
down with sidelong glance, "it honoureth thee that thou 
soughtest for greatness, but it betrayeth thee also. Thou art not 
great. 

Thou bad old magician, that is the best and the honestest 
thing I honour in thee, that thou hast become weary of thy 
self, and hast expressed it: I am not great. 

Therein do I honour thee as a penitent-in-spirit, and 
although only for the twinkling of an eye, in that one moment 
wast thou genuine. 

But tell me, what seekest thou here in my forests and rocks? 
And if thou hast put thyself in my way, what proof of me 
wouldst thou have? 

Wherein didst thou put me to the test?" 

Thus spake Zarathustra, and his eyes sparkled. But the old 
magician kept silence for a while; then said he: "Did I put thee 
to the test? I seek only. 

O Zarathustra, I seek a genuine one, a right one, a simple 



THE MAGICIAN 287 

one, an unequivocal one, a man of perfect honesty, a vessel of 
wisdom, a saint of knowledge, a great man! 

Knowest thou it not, O Zarathustra? / seek Zarathustra." 

And here there arose a long silence between them: Zara 
thustra, however, became profoundly absorbed in thought, so 
that he shut his eyes. But afterwards coming back to the situa 
tion, he grasped the hand of the magician, and said, full of 
politeness and policy: 

"Well! Up thither leadeth the way, there is the cave of 
Zarathustra. In it mayest thou seek him whom thou wouldst 
fain find. 

And ask counsel of mine animals, mine eagle and my se? 
pent: they shall help thee to seek. My cave however is large. 

I myself, to be sure I have as yet seen no great man. That 
which is great, the acutest eye is at present insensible to it. It 
is the kingdom of the populace. 

Many a one have I found who stretched and inflated him 
self, and the people cried: Behold; a great man! But what 
good do all bellows do! The wind cometh out at last. 

At last bursteth the frog which hath inflated itself too long: 
then cometh out the wind. To prick a swollen one in the belly, 
I call good pastime. Hear that, ye boys! 

Our today is of the popular: who still knoweth what is 
great and what is small! Who could there seek successfully for 
greatness! A fool only: it succeedeth with fools. 

Thou seekest for great men, thou strange fool? Who taught 
that to thee? Is today the time for it? Oh, thou bad seeker, why 
dost thou tempt me?" 

Thus spake Zarathustra, comforted in his heart, and went 

laughing on his way.

66. Out of Service 

NOT long, however, after Zarathustra had freed hi^elf from 
the magician, he again saw a person sitting beside the path 
which he followed, namely a tall, black man, with a haggard, 
pale countenance: this man grieved him exceedingly. "Alas," 
said he to his heart, "there sitteth disguised affliction; me- 
thinketh he is of the type of the priests: what do they want in 
my domain? 

What! Hardly have I escaped from that magician, and must 
another necromancer again run across my path, 

Some sorcerer with laying-on-of -hands, some sombre 
wonder-worker by the grace of God, some anointed world- 
maligner, whom, may the devil take! 

But the devil is never at the place which would be his right 
place: he always cometh too late, that cursed dwarf and club- 
foot!" 

Thus cursed Zarathustra impatiently in his heart, and con 
sidered how with averted look he might slip past the black 
man. But behold, it came about otherwise. For at the same 
moment had the sitting one already perceived him; and not 
unlike one whom an unexpected happiness overtaketh, he 
sprang to his feet, and went straight towards Zarathustra. 

Whoever thou art, thou traveller," said he, "help a strayed 
one, a seeker, an old man, who may here easily come to grief! 

The world here is strange to me, and remote; wild beasts 
also did I hear howling; and he who could have given me pro* 
tection he is himself no more. 

I was seeking the last pious man, a saint and an anchorite, 



OUT OF SERVICE 289 

who, alone in his forest, had not yet heard D what all the 
world knoweth at present." 

"What doth all the world know at present?" asked Zara- 
thustra. "Perhaps that the old God no longer liveth, in whom 
all the world once believed?" 

"Thou sayest it," answered the old man sorrowfully. "And 
I served that old God until his last hour. 

Now, however, am I out of service, without master, and yet 
not free; likewise am I no longer merry even for an hour, 
except it be in recollections. 

Therefore did I ascend into these mountains, that I might 
finally have a festival for myself once more, as becometh an 
old pope and church-father: for know it, that I am the last 
pope! a festival of pious recollections and divine services. 

Now, however, is he himself dead, the most pious of men, 
the saint in the forest, who praised his God constantly with 
singing and mumbling. 

He himself found I no longer when I found his cot but 
two wolves found I therein, which howled on account of his 
death, for all animals loved him. Then did I haste away. 

Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains? 
Then did my heart determine that I should seek another, the 
most pious of all those who believe not in God , my heart 
determined that I should seek Zarathustra!" 

Thus spake the hoary man, and gazed with keen eyes at him 
who stood before him. Zarathustra however seized the hand 
of the old pope and regarded it a long while with admiration. 

"Lo! thou venerable one," said he then, "what a fine and 
long hand! That is the hand of one who hath ever dispensed 
blessings. Now, however, doth it hold fast him whom thou 
seekest me, Zarathustra. 



290 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

It is I, the ungodly Zarathustra, who saith: Who is un- 
godlier than I, that I may enjoy his teaching? " 

Thus spake Zarathustra, and penetrated with his glances 
the thoughts and arrear-thoughts of the old pope. At last the 
latter began: 

"He who most loved and possessed him hath now also lost 
him most : 

Lo, I myself am surely the most godless of us at present? 
But who could rejoice at that!" 

"Thou servedst him to the last?" asked Zarathustra 
thoughtfully, after a deep silence, "thou knowest how he 
died? Is it true what they say, that sympathy choked him; 

That he saw how man hung on the cross, and could not 
endure it; that his love to man became his hell, and at last his 
death?"- 

The old pope however did not answer, but looked aside 
timidly, with a painful and gloomy expression. 

"Let him go," said Zarathustra, after prolonged meditation, 
still looking the old man straight in the eye. 

"Let him go, he is gone. And though it honoureth thee that 
thou speakest only in praise of this dead one, yet thou knowest 
as well as I who he was, and that he went curious ways." 

"To speak before three eyes," said the old pope cheerfully 
(he was blind of one eye), "in divine matters I am more en 
lightened than Zarathustra himself and may well be so. 

My love served him long years, my will followed all his will. 
A good servant, however, knoweth everything, and many a 
thing even which a master hideth from himself. 

He was a hidden God, full of secrecy. Verily, he did not 
come by his son otherwise than by secret ways. At the door of 
his faith standeth adultery. 

Whoever extolleth him as a God of love, doth not think 



OUT OF SERVICE 29! 

highly enough of love itself. Did not that God want also to 
be judge? But the loving one loveth irrespective of reward 
and requital. 

When he was young, that God out of the Orient, then was 
he harsh and revengeful, and built himself a hell for the 
delight of his favourites. 

At last, however, he became old and soft and mellow and 
pitiful, more like a grandfather than a father, but most like 
a tottering old grandmother. 

There did he sit shrivelled in his chimney-corner, fretting 
on account of his weak legs, world-weary, will-weary, and one 
day he suffocated of his all-too-great pity."- 

Thou old pope," said here Zarathustra interposing, "hast 
thou seen thai with thine eyes? It could well have happened 
in that way: in that way, and also otherwise. When gods die 
they always die many kinds of death. 

Weil! At all events, one way or other he is gone! He was 
counter to the taste of mine ears and eyes; worse than that I 
should not like to say against him. 

I love everything that looketh bright and speaketh honestly. 
But he thou knowest it, forsooth, thou old priest, there was 
something of thy type in him, the priest- type he was equivo 
cal. 

He was also indistinct. How he raged at us, this wrath- 
snorter, because we understood him badly! But why did he 
not speak more clearly? 

And if the fault lay in our ears, why did he give us ears that 
heard him badly? If there was dirt in our ears, well! who put 
it in them? 

Too much miscarried with him, this potter who had not 
learned thoroughly! That he took revenge on his pots and

creations, however, because they turned out badly that was a 
sin against good taste. 

There is also good taste in piety: this at last said : Away with 
such a God! Better to have no God, better to set up destiny on 
one s own account, better to be a fool, better to be God 
oneself! 

"What do I hear!" said then the old pope, with intent 
ears; "O Zarathustra, thou art more pious than thou believest, 
with such an unbelief! Some god in thee hath converted thee 
to thine ungodliness. 

Is it not thy piety itself which no longer letteth thee be 
lieve in a God? And thine over-great honesty will yet lead 
thee even beyond good and evil! 

Behold, what hath been reserved for thee? Thou hast eyes 
and hands and mouth, which have been predestined for bless 
ing from eternity. One doth not bless with the hand alone. 

Nigh unto thee, though thou professest to be the ungod- 
liest one, I feel a hale and holy odour of long benedictions : I 
feel glad and grieved thereby. 

Let me be thy guest, O Zarathustra, for a single night! 
Nowhere on earth shall I now feel better than with thee!" 

"Amen! So shall it be!" said Zarathustra, with great aston 
ishment; "up thither leadeth the way, there lieth the cave of 
Zarathustra. 

Gladly, forsooth, would I conduct thee thither myself, thou 
venerable one; for I love all pious men. But now a cry of dis 
tress calleth me hastily away from thee. 

In my domain shall no one come to grief; my cave is a 
good haven. And best of all would I like to put every sorrowful 
one again on firm land and fin^ legs. 



THE UGLIEST MAN 293 

Who, however, could take thy melancholy off thy shoulders? 
For that I am too weak. Long, verily, should we have to wait 
until some one re-awoke thy God for thee. 

For that old God liveth no more: he is indeed dead." 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



. The Ugliest Man 



AND again did Zarathustra s feet run through mountains 
and forests, and his eyes sought and sought, but nowhere was 
he to be seen whom they wanted to see the sorely distressed 
sufferer and crier. On the whole way, however, he rejoiced in 
his heart and was full of gratitude. "What good things," said 
he, "hath this day given me, as amends for its bad beginning! 
What strange interlocutors have I found! 

At their words will I now chew a long while as at good corn; 
small shall my teeth grind and crush them, until they flow like 
milk into my soul!" 

When, however, the path again curved round a rock, all at 
once the landscape changed, and Zarathustra entered into a 
realm of death. Here bristled aloft black and red cliffs, with 
out any grass, tree, or bird s voice. For it was a valley which all 
animals avoided, even the beasts of prey, except that a species 
of ugly, thick, green serpent came here to die when they be 
came old. Therefore the shepherds called this valley: "Serpent- 
death." 

Zarathustra, however, became absorbed in dark recollec 
tions, for it seemed to him as if he had once before stood in 



294 THUS .PAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

this valley. And much heaviness settled on his mind, so that 
he walked slowly and always more slowly, and at last stood 
still. Then, however, when he opened his eyes, he saw some 
thing sitting by the wayside shaped like a man, and hardly 
like a man, something nondescript. And all at once there came 
over Zarathustra a great shame, because he had gazed on such 
a thing. Blushing up to the very roots of his white hair, he 
turned aside his glance, and raised his foot that he might 
leave this ill-starred place. Then, however, became the dead 
wilderness vocal: for from the ground a noise welled up, 
gurgling and rattling, as water gurgleth and rartleth at night 
through stopped-up water-pipes; and at last it turned into 
human voice and human speech: it sounded thus: 

"Zarathustra! Zarathustra! Read my riddle! Say, say! What 
is the revenge on the witness? 

I entice thee back; here is smooth ice! See to it, see to it, 
that thy pride does not here break its legs! 

Thou thinkest thyself wise, thou proud Zarathustra! Read 
then the riddle, thou hard nut-cracker, the riddle that I am! 
Say then : who am I!" 

When however Zarathustra had heard these words, 
what think ye then took place in his soul? Pity overcame him; 
and he sank down all at once, like an oak that hath long with 
stood many tree-fellers, heavily, suddenly, to the terror even 
of those who meant to fell it. But immediately he got up 
again from the ground, and his countenance became stern. 

"I know thee well," said he, with a brazen voice, "thou art 
the murderer of God! Let me go. 

Thou couldst not endure him who beheld thee, who ever 
beheld thee through and through, thou ugliest man. Thou 
tookest revenge on this witness!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra and was about to go; but the non- 



THE UGLIEST MAN 295 

descript grasped at a corner of his garment and began anew 
to gurgle and seek for words. "Stay," said he at last 

"Stay! Do not pass by! I have divined what axe it was 
that struck thee to the ground : hail to thee, O Zarathustra, that 
thou art again upon thy feet! 

Thou hast divined, I know it well, how the man f eeleth who 
killed him, the murderer of God. Stay! Sit down here be 
side me; it is not to no purpose. 

To whom would I go but unto thee? Stay, sit down! Do not 
however look at me! Honour thus mine ugliness! 

They persecute me: now art thou my last refuge. Not with 
their hatred, not with their bailiffs; Oh, such persecution 
would I mock at, and be proud and cheerful! 

Hath not all success hitherto been with the well-persecuted 
ones? And he who persecuteth well learneth readily to be 
ob sequent when once he is put behind! But it is their pity 

Their pity is it from which I flee away and flee to thee. O 
Zarathustra, protect me, thou, my last refuge, thou sole one 
whodivinedstme: 

Thou hast divined how the mail f eeleth who killed him. 
Stay! And if thou wilt go, thou impatient one, go not the way 
that I came. That way is bad. 

Art thou angry with me because I have already racked lan 
guage too long? Because I have already counselled thee? But 
know that it is I, the ugliest man, 

Who have also the largest, heaviest feet. Where 7 have 
gone, the way is bad. I tread all paths to death and destruction. 

But that thou passedst me by in silence, that thou blushedst 
I saw it well: thereby did I know thee as Zarathustra. 

Every one else would have thrown to me his alms, his pity, 
in look and speech. But for that I am not beggar enough: 
didst thou divine. 



296 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

For that I am too rich, rich in what if fcreat, frightful, 
ugliest, most unutterable! Thy shame, O Zarathustra, honoured 
me! 

With difficulty did I get out of the crowd of the pitiful, 
that I might find the only one who at present teacheth that pity 
is obtrusive thyself, O Zarathustra! 

Whether it be the pity of a God, or whether it be human 
pity, it is offensive to modesty. And unwillingness to help may 
be nobler than the virtue that rusheth to do so. 

That however namely, pity is called virtue itself at 
present by all petty people; they have no reverence for great 
misfortune, great ugliness, great failure. 

Beyond all these do I look, as a dog looketh over the backs 
of thronging flocks of sheep. They are petty, good-wooled, 
good-willed, grey people. 

As the heron looketh contemptuously at shallow pools, with 
backward-bent head, so do I look at the throng of grey little 
waves and wills and souls. 

Too long have we acknowledged them to be right, those 
petty people: so we have at last given them power as well; 
and now do they teach that good is only wiiat petty people 
call good. 

And truth is at present what the preacher spake who him 
self sprang from them, that singular saint and advocate of 
the petty people, who testified of himself: I am the truth. 

That immodest one hath long made the petty people greatly 
puffed up, he who taught no small error when he taught: I 
am the truth. 

Hath an immodest one ever been answered more courte 
ously? Thou, however, O Zarathustra, passedst him by, and 
saidst: Nay! Nay! Three times Nay! 

Thou warnedst against his error; thou warnedst the first 



THE UGLIEST MAN 297 

to do so against pity: not every one, not none, but thyself 
and thy type. 

Thou art ashamed of the shame of the great sufferer; and 
verily when thou sayest: From pity there cometh a heavy 
cloud; take heed, ye men! 

When thou teachest: All creators are hard, all great love 
is beyond their pity: O Zarathustra, how well versed dost 
thou seem to me in weather-signs! 

Thou thyself, however, warn thyself also against thy pity! 
For many are on their way to thee, many suffering, doubting, 
despairing, drowning, freezing ones 

I warn thee also against myself. Thou hast read my best, my 
worst riddle, myself, and what I have done. I know the axe that 
felleth thee. 

But he had to die: he looked with eyes which beheld 
everything, he beheld men s depths and dregs, all his hidden 
ignominy and ugliness. 

His pity knew no modesty: he crept into my dirtiest corners. 
This most prying, over-intrusive, over-pitiful one had to die. 

He ever beheld me: on such a witness I would have revenge 
or not live myself. 

The God who beheld everything, and also man: that God 
had to die! Man cannot endure it that such a witness should 
live." 

Thus spake the ugliest man. Zarathustra however got up, 
and prepared to go on: for he felt frozen to the very bowels. 

"Thou nondescript," said he, "thou warnedst me against 
thy path. As thanks for it I praise mine to thee. Behold, up 
thither is the cave of Zarathustra. 

My cave is large and deep and hath many corners; there 
findeth he that is most hidden his hiding-place. And close be- 



298 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

side k, there are a hundred lurking-places and by-places tor 
creeping, fluttering, and hopping creatures. 

Thou outcast, who hast cast thyself out, thou wilt not live 
amongst men and men s pity? Well then, do like me! Thus 
wilt thou learn also from me; only the doer learneth. 

And talk first and foremost to mine animals! The proudest 
animal and the wisest animal they might well be the right 
counsellors for us both!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra and went his way, more thought 
fully and slowly even than before: for he asked himself many 
things, and hardly knew what to answer. 

"How poor indeed is man," thought he in his heart, "how 
ugly, how wheezy, how full of hidden shame! 

They tell me that man loveth himself. Ah, how great must 
that self-love be! How much contempt is opposed to it! 

Even this man hath loved himself, as he hath despised him 
self, a great lover methinketh he is, and a great despiser. 

No one have I yet found who more thoroughly despised 
himself: even that is elevation. Alas, was this perhaps the 
higher man whose cry I heard? 

I love the great despisers, Man is something that hath to be 
surpassed." 



68. The Voluntary Beggar 



WHEN Zarathustra had left the ugliest man, he was chilled and 
felt lonesome: for much coldness and lonesomeness came over 
his spirit, so that even his limbs became colder thereby. When, 
however, he wandered on and on, uphill and down, at times 



THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR 299 

past green meadows, though also sometimes over wild stony 
couches where formerly perhaps an impatient brook had made 
its bed, then he turned all at once warmer and heartier again. 

"What hath happened unto me?" he asked himself, "some 
thing warm and living quickeneth me; it must be in the neigh 
bourhood. 

Already am I less alone; unconscious companions and 
brethren rove around me; their warm breath toucheth my 
soul." 

When, however, he spied about and sought for the com 
forters of his lonesomeness, behold, there were kine there 
standing together on an eminence, whose proximity and smell 
had warmed his heart. The kine, however, seemed to listen 
eagerly to a speaker, and took no heed of him who approached. 
When, however, Zarathustra was quite nigh unto them, then 
did he hear plainly that a human voice spake in the midst of 
the kine, and apparently all of them had turned their heads 
towards the speaker. 

Then ran Zarathustra up speedily and drove the animals 
aside; for he feared that some one had here met with harm, 
which the pity of the kine would hardly be able to relieve. But 
in this he was deceived; for behold, there sat a man on the 
ground who seemed to be persuading the animals to have no 
fear of him, a peaceable man and Preacher-on-the-Mount, out 
of whose eyes kindness itself preached. "What dost thou seek 
here?" called out Zarathustra in astonishment. 

"What do I here seek?" answered he: "the same that thou 
seekest, thou mischief-maker; that is to say, happiness upon 
earth. 

To that end, however, I would fain learn of these kine. For 
\ tell thee that I have already talked half a morning unto 



30O THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

them, and just now were they about to give me their answer. 
Why dost thou disturb them? 

Except we be converted and become as kine, we shall in no 
wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. For we ought to learn 
from them one thing: ruminating. 

And verily, although a man should gain the whole world, 
and yet not learn one thing, ruminating, what would it profit 
him! He would not be rid of his affliction, 

His great affliction: that, however, is at present called 
disgust. Who hath not at present his heart, his mouth and his 
eyes full of disgust? Thou also! Thou also! But behold these 
kine!"- 

Thus spake the Preacher-on-the-Mount, and turned then his 
own look towards Zarathustra for hitherto it had rested 
lovingly on the kine : then, however, he put on a different ex 
pression. "Who is this with whom I talk?" he exclaimed, 
frightened, and sprang up from the ground. 

"This is the man without disgust, this is Zarathustra him 
self, the surmounter of the great disgust, this is the eye, this 
is the mouth, this is the heart of Zarathustra himself." 

And whilst he thus spake he kissed with o erflowing eyes 
the hands of him with whom he spake, and behaved alto 
gether like one to whom a precious gift and jewel hath fallen 
unawares from heaven. The kine, however, gazed at it all and 
wondered. 

"Speak not of me, thou strange one; thou amiable one!" said 
Zarathustra, and restrained his affection, "speak to me firstly 
of thyself! Art thou not the voluntary beggar who once cast 
away great riches, 

Who was ashamed of his riches and of the rich, and fled 
to the poorest to bestow upon them his abundance and his 
heart? But they received him not," 



THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR 301 

"But they received me not," said the voluntary beggar, thou 
knowest it, forsooth. So I went at last to the animals and to 
those kine." 

"Then learnedst thou," interrupted Zarathustra, "how much 
harder it is to give properly than to take properly, and that be 
stowing well is an art the last, subtlest master-art of kind 
ness." 

"Especially nowadays," answered the voluntary beggar: "at 
present, that is to say, when everything low hath become re 
bellious and exclusive and haughty in its manner in the 
manner of the populace. 

For the hour hath come, thou knowest it forsooth, for the 
great, evil, long, slow mob-and-slave-insurrection: it extendeth 
and extendeth! 

Now doth it provoke the lower classes, all benevolence and 
petty giving; and the overrich may be on their guard! 

Whoever at present drip, like bulgy bottles out of all-too- 
small necks: of such bottles at present one willingly breaketh 
the necks. 

Wanton avidity, bilious envy, careworn revenge, populace- 
pride: all these struck mine eye. It is no longer true that the 
poor are blessed. The kingdom of heaven, however, is with 
the kine." 

"And why is it not with the rich?" asked Zarathustra tempt 
ingly, while he kept back the kine which sniff ed familiarly at 
the peaceful one. 

"Why dost thou tempt me?" answered the other. "Thou 
knowest it thyself better even than I. What was it drove me 
to the poorest, O Zarathustra? Was it not my disgust at the 
richest? 

At the culprits of riches, with cold eyes and rank thoughts, 



THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

who pick up profit out of all kinds of rubbish at tins rabble 
that stinketh to heaven, 

At this gilded, falsified populace, whose fathers were 
pickpockets, or carrion-crows, or rag-pickers, with wives com 
pliant, lewd and forgetful: for they are all of them not far 
different from harlots 

Populace above, populace below! What are poor and rich 
at present! That distinction did I unlearn, then did I flee 
away further and ever further, until I came to those kine." 

Thus spake the peaceful one, and puffed himself and per 
spired with his words : so that the kine wondered anew. Zara- 
thustra, however, kept looking into his face with a smile, all 
the time the man talked so severely and shook silently his 
head. 

"Thou doest violence to thyself, thou Preacher-on-the- 
Mount, when thou usest such severe words. For such severity 
neither thy mouth nor thine eye have been given thee. 

Nor, methinketh, hath thy stomach either: unto / / all such 
rage and hatred and foaming-over is repugnant. Thy stomach 
wanteth softer things : thou art not a butcher. 

Rather seemest thou to me a plant-eater and a root-man. 
Perhaps thou grindest corn. Certainly, however, thou art averse 
to fleshly joys, and thou lovest honey." 

"Thou hast divined me well," answered the voluntary beg 
gar, with lightened heart. "I love honey, I also grind corn; for 
I have sought out what tasteth sweetly and maketh pure breath : 

Also what recjuireth a long time, a day s- work and a 
mouth s- work for gentle idlers and sluggards. 

Furthest, to be sure, have those kine carried it: they have de 
vised ruminating and lying in the sun. They also abstain from 
all heavy thoughts which inflate the heart." 

"Well!" said Zarathustra, "thou shouldst also see min*

present exist on earth. 

Behold, thither leadeth the way to my cave: be tonight its 
guest. And talk to mine animals of the happiness of animals, 

Until I myself come home. For now a cry of distress 
calleth me hastily away from thee. Also, shouldst thou find 
new honey with me, ice-cold, golden-comb-honey, eat it! 

Now, however, take leave at once of thy kine, thou strange 
one! thou amiable one! though it be hard for thee. For they 
are thy warmest friends and preceptors!" 

-"One excepted, whom I hold still dearer," answered the 
voluntary beggar. "Thou thyself art good, O Zarathustra, and 
better even than a cow!" 

"Away, away with thee! thou evil flatterer!" cried Zarathus 
tra mischievously, "why dost thou spoil me with such praise 
and flattery-honey? 

"Away, away from me!" cried he once more, and heaved 
his stick at the fond beggar, who, however, ran nimbly away. 



69. The Shadow 



SCARCELY however was the voluntary beggar gone in haste, 
and Zarathustra again alone, when he heard behind him a new 
voice which called out: "Stay! Zarathustra! Do wait! It if 
myself, forsooth, O Zarathustra, myself, thy shadow!" But 
Zarathustra did not wait; for a sudden irritation came over 
him on account of the crowd and the crowding in his moun 
tains. "Whither hath my lonesomeness gone?" spake he. 



THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

"It is verily becoming too much for me; these mountains 
swarm; my kingdom is no longer of this world; I require new 
mountains. 

My shadow calleth me? What matter about my shadow! Let 
it run after me! I run away from it." 

Thus spake Zarathustra to his heart and ran away. But the 
one behind followed after him, so that immediately there were 
three runners, one after the other namely, foremost the 
voluntary beggar, then Zarathustra, and thirdly, and hindmost, 
his shadow. But not long had they run thus when Zarathustra 
became conscious of his folly, and shook off with one jerk all 
his irritation and detestation. 

"What!" said he, "have not the most ludicrous things 
always happened to us old anchorites and saints? 

Verily, my folly hath grown big in the mountains! Now do 
I hear six old fools legs rattling behind one another! 

But doth Zarathustra need to be frightened by his shadow? 
Also, methinketh that after all it hath longer legs than mine." 

Thus spake Zarathustra, and, laughing with eyes and en 
trails, he stood still and turned round quickly and behold, 
he almost thereby threw his shadow and follower to the 
ground, so closely had the latter followed at his heels, and so 
weak was he. For when Zarathustra scrutinised him with his 
glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition, so slender, 
swarthy, hollow and worn-out did this follower appear. 

"Who art thou?" asked Zarathustra vehemently, "what doest 
thou here? And why callest thou thyself my shadow? Thou art 
not pleasing unto me." 

"Forgive me," answered the shadow, "that it is I; and if I 
please thee not well, O Zarathustra! therein do I admire thee 
and thy good taste. 



THE SHADOW 305 

A wanderer am I, who have walked long at thy heels; always 
on the way, but without a goal, also without a home: so that 
verily, I lack little of being the eternally Wandering Jew, 
except that I am not eternal and not a Jew, 

What? Must I ever be on the way? Whirled by every wind, 
unsettled, driven about? O earth, thou hast become too round 
for me! 

On every surface have I already sat, like tired dust have I 
fallen asleep on mirrors and window-panes: everything taketh 
from me, nothing giveth; I become thin I am almost equal 
to a shadow. 

After thee, however, O Zarathustra, did I fly and hie longest; 
and though I hid myself from thee, I was nevertheless thy 
best shadow: wherever thou hast sat, there sat I also. 

With thee have I wandered about in the remotest, coldest 
worlds, like a phantom that voluntarily haunteth winter roofs 
and snows. 

With thee have I pushed into all the forbidden, all the worst 
and the furthest: and if there be anything of virtue in me, it is 
that I have had no fear of any prohibition. 

With thee have I broken up whatever my heart revered; all 
boundary-stones and statues have I o erthrown; the most dan 
gerous wishes did I pursue, verily, beyond every crime did I 
once go. 

With thee did I unlearn the belief in words and worths and 
in great names. When the devil casteth his skin, doth not his 
name also fall away? It is also skin. The devil himself is 
perhaps skin. 

Nothing is true, all is permitted : so said I to myself. Into 
the coldest water did I plunge with head and heart. Ah, how 
oft did I stand there naked on that account, like a red crab! 



306 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Ah, where have gone all my goodness and all my shame and 
all my belief in the good! Ah, where is the lying innocence 
which I once possessed, the innocence of the good and of their 
noble lies! 

Too oft, verily, did I follow close to the heels of truth: then 
did it kick me on the face. Sometimes I meant to lie, and be 
hold! then only did I hit the truth. 

Too much hath become clear unto me: now it doth not con 
cern me any more. Nothing liveth any longer that I love, 
how should I still love myself? 

To live as I incline, or not to live at all : so do I wish; so 
wisheth also the holiest. But alas! how have / still inclina 
tion? 

Have / still a goal? A haven towards which my sail is set? 

A good wind? Ah, he only who knoweth whither he saileth, 
knoweth what wind is good, and a fair wind for him. 

What still remaineth to me? A heart weary and flippant; 
an unstable will; fluttering wings; a broken backbone. 

This seeking for my home: O Zarathustra, dost thou know 
that this seeking hath been my home-sickening; it eateth me up. 

Where is my home? For it do I ask and seek, and have 
sought, but have not found it. O eternal everywhere, O eternal 
nowhere, O eternal in-vain!" 

Thus spake the shadow, and Zarathustra s countenance 
lengthened at his words. "Thou art my shadow!" said he at 
last sadly. 

"Thy danger is not small, thou free spirit and wanderer! 
Thou hast had a bad day: see that a still worse evening doth 
not overtake thee! 

To such unsettled ones as thou, seemeth at last even a 



NOONTIDE 307 

prisoner blessed. Didst thou ever see how captured criminals 
sleep? They sleep quietly, they enjoy their new security. 

Beware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee, a hard, 
rigorous delusion! For now everything that is narrow and fixed 
seduceth and tempteth thee. 

Thou hast lost thy goal. Alas, how wilt thou forego and 
forget that loss? Thereby hast thou also lost thy way! 

Thou poor rover and rambler, thou tired butterfly! wilt thou 
have a rest and a home this evening? Then go up to my cave! 

Thither leadeth the way to my cave. And now will I run 
quickly away from thee again. Already lieth as it were a 
shadow upon me. 

I will run alone, so that it may again become bright around 
me. Therefore must I still be a long time merrily upon my 
legs. In the evening, however, there will be dancing with 
me!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



. Noontide 



AND Zarathustra ran and ran, but he found no one else, 
and was alone and ever found himself again; he enjoyed and 
quaffed his solitude, and thought of good things for hours. 
About the hour of noontide, however, when the sun stood 
exactly over Zarathustra s head, he passed an old, bent and 
gnarled tree, which was encircled round by the ardent love of 
a vine, and hidden from itself; from this there hung yellow 



308 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

grapes in abundance, confronting the wanderer. Then he felt 
inclined to quench a little thirst, and to break off for himself a 
cluster of grapes. When, however, he had already his arm out 
stretched for that purpose, he felt still more inclined for some 
thing else namely, to lie down beside the tree at the hour of 
perfect noontide and sleep. 

This Zarathustra did; and no sooner had he laid himself on 
the ground in the stillness and secrecy of the variegated grass, 
than he had forgotten his little thirst, and fell asleep. For as 
the proverb of Zarathustra saith: "One thing is more neces 
sary than the other." Only that his eyes remained open: for 
they never grew weary of viewing and admiring the tree and 
the love of the vine. In falling asleep, however, Zarathustra 
spake thus to his heart: 

"Hush! Hush! Hath not the world now become perfect? 
What hath happened unto me? 

As a delicate wind danceth invisibly upon parqueted seas, 
light, feather-light, so danceth sleep upon me. 

No eye doth it close to me, it leaveth my soul awake. Light 
is it, verily, feather-light. 

It persuadeth me, I know not how, it toucheth me inwardly 
with a caressing hand, it constraineth me. Yea, it constraineth 
me, so that my soul stretcheth itself out: - 

How long and weary it becometh, my strange soul! Hath 
a seventh-day evening come to it precisely at noontide? Hath 
it already wandered too long, blissfully, among good and ripe 
things? 

It stretcheth itself out, long longer! it lieth still, my strange 
jouL Too many good things hath it already tasted; this golden 
sadness oppresseth it, it distorteth its mouth. 

As a ship that putteth into the calmest cove: it now 



NOONTIDE 309 

draweth up to the land, weary of long voyages and uncertain 
seas. Is not the land more faithful 5 

As such a ship huggeth the shore, tuggeth the shore: then 
it sufficeth for a spider to spin its thread from the ship to the 
land. No stronger ropes are required there. 

As such a weary ship in the calmest cove, so do I also now 
repose, nigh to the earth, faithful, trusting, waiting, bound 
to it with the lightest threads. 

O happiness! O happiness! Wilt thou perhaps sing, O my 
soul? Thou liest in the grass. But this is the secret, solemn hour, 
when no shepherd playeth his pipe. 

Take care! Hot noontide sleepeth on the fields. Do not sing! 
Hush! The world is perfect. 

Do not sing, thou prairie-bird, my soul! Do not even whis 
per! Lo hush! The old noontide sleepeth, it moveth its 
mouth: doth it not just now drink a drop of happiness 

An old brown drop of golden happiness, golden wine? 
Something whisketh over it, its happiness laugheth. Thus 
laugheth a God. Hush! 

For happiness, how little sufficeth for happiness! Thus 
spake I once and thought myself wise. But it was a blasphemy: 
that have I now learned. Wise fools speak better. 

The least thing precisely, the gentlest thing, the lightest 
thing, a lizard s rustling, a breath, a whisk, an eye-glance 
little maketh up the best happiness. Hush! 

What hath befallen me: Hark! Hath time flown away? 
Do I not fall? Have I not fallen hark! into the well of 
eternity? 

What happeneth to me? Hush! It stingeth me alas rj 
the heart? To the heart! Oh, break up, break up, my n-arr, 
after such happiness, after such a sting! 



3IO THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

What? Hath not the world just now become perfect? 
Round and ripe? Oh, for the golden round ring whither 
doth it fly? Let me run after it! Quick! 

Hush (and here Zarathustra stretched himself, and 
felt that he was asleep.) 

"Up!" said he to himself, "thou sleeper! Thou noontide 
sleeper! Well then, up, ye old legs! It is time and more than 
time; many a good stretch of road is still awaiting you 

Now have ye slept your fill; for how long a time? A half- 
eternity! Well then, up now, mine old heart! For how long 
after such a sleep mayest thou remain awake?" 

(But then did he fall asleep anew, and his soul spake against 
him and defended itself, and lay down again) "Leave me 
alone! Hush! Hath not the world just now become perfect? 
Oh, for the golden round ball!"- 

"Get up," said Zarathustra, "thou little thief, thou slug 
gard! What! Still stretching thyself, yawning, sighing, falling 
into deep wells? 

Who art thou then, O my soul!" ( and here he became fright 
ened, for a sunbeam shot down from heaven upon his face. ) 

"O heaven above me," said he sighing, and sat upright, 
"thou gazest at me? Thou hearkenest unto my strange soul? 

When wilt thou drink this drop of dew that fell down upon 
all earthly things, when wilt thou drink this strange soul 

When, thou well of eternity! thou joyous, awful, noon 
tide abyss! when wilt thou drink my soul back into thee?" 

Thus spake Zarathustra, and rose from his couch beside the 
tree, as if awakening from a strange drunkenness: and behold 
there stood the sun still exactly above his head. One might, 
however, rightly infer therefrom that Zarathustra had not- 
then, slept long. 



THE GREETING 3:1 

77. The Greeting 

IT WAS fate in the afternoon only when Zarathustra, after long 
useless searching and strolling about, again came home to his 
cave. When, however, he stood over against it, not more than 
twenty paces therefrom, the thing happened which he now 
least of all expected: he heard anew the great cry of distress. 
And extraordinary! this time the cry came out of his own cave. 
It was a long, manifold, peculiar cry, and Zarathustra plainly 
distinguished that it was composed of many voices: although 
heard at a distance it might sound like the cry out of a single 
mouth. 

Thereupon Zarathustra rushed forward to his cave, an 1 
behold! what a spectacle awaited him after that concert! For 
there did they all sit together whom he had passed during the 
day: the king on the right and the king on the left, the old 
magician, the pope, the voluntary beggar, the shadow, the in 
tellectually conscientious one, the sorrowful soothsayer, and 
the ass; the ugliest man, however, had set a crown on his head, 
and had put round him two purple girdles, for he liked, like 
all ugly ones, to disguise himself and play the handsome per 
son. In the midst, however, of that sorrowful company stood 
Zarathustra s eagle, ruffled and disquieted, for it had been 
called upon to answer too much for which its pride had not any 
answer; the wise serpent however hung round its neck. 

All this did Zarathustra behold with great astonishment; 
then however he scrutinised each individual guest with cour* 
teous curiosity, read their souls and wondered anew. In the 
meantime the assembled ones had risen from their seats, and 
waited with reverence for Zarathustra to speak. Zarathustra. 
however spake thus: 



3*2 THt*g SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

"Ye despairing ones! Ye strange ones! So it was your cry uf 
distress that I heard? And now do I know also where he is to 
be sought, whom I have sought for in vain today: the higher 
man : 

In mine own cave sitteth he, the higher man 1 But why do 
J wonder! Have not I myself allured him to me by honey- 
offerings and artful lure-calls of my happiness? 

But it seemeth to me that ye are badly adapted for com 
pany: ye make one another s hearts fretful, ye that cry for 
help, when ye sit here together? There is one that must first 
come, 

One who will make you laugh once more, a good jovial 
buffoon, a dancer, a wind, a wild romp, some old fool: 
what think ye? 

Forgive me, however, ye despairing ones, for speaking such 
trivial words before you, unworthy, verily, of such guests! 
But ye do not divine what maketh my heart wanton: 

Ye yourselves do it, and your aspect, forgive it me! For 
every one becometh courageous who beholdeth a despairing 
one. To encourage a despairing one every one thinketh him 
self strong enough to do so. 

To myself have ye given this power, a good gift, mine 
honourable guests! An excellent guest s-present! Well, do not 
then upbraid when I also offer you something of mine. 

This is mine empire and my dominion: that which is mine, 
however, shall this evening and tonight be yours. Mine ani 
mals shall serve you : let my cave be your resting-place! 

At house and home with me shall no one despair: in my 
purlieus do I protect every one from his wild beasts. And that 
is the first thing which I offer you: security! 

The second thing, however, is my little finger. And when ye 



THE GREETING 313 

have that, then take the whole hand also, yea and the heart 
with it! Welcome here, welcome to you, my guests!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra, and laughed with love and mis 
chief. After this greeting his guests bowed once more and were 
reverentially silent; the king on the right, however, answered 
him in their name. 

"O Zarathustra, by the way in which thou hast given us thy 
hand and thy greeting, we recognise thee as Zarathustra. Thou 
hast humbled thyself before us; almost hast thou hurt our 
reverence : 

Who however could have humbled himself as thou hast 
done, with such pride? That uplifteth us ourselves; a refresh 
ment is it, to our eyes and hearts. 

To behold this, merely, gladly would we ascend higher 
mountains than this. For as eager beholders have we come; we 
wanted to see what brighteneth dim eyes. 

And lo! now is it all over with our cries of distress. Now 
are our minds and hearts open and enraptured. Little is lack 
ing for our spirits to become wanton. 

There is nothing, O Zarathustra, that groweth more pleas 
ingly on earth than a lofty, strong will : it is the finest growth. 
An entire landscape refresheth itself at one such tree. 

To the pine do I compare him, O Zarathustra, which 
groweth up like thee tall, silent, hardy, solitary, of the best, 
supplest wood, stately, 

In the end, however, grasping out for its dominion with 
strong, green branches, asking weighty questions of the wind, 
the storm, and whatever is at home on high places; 

Answering more weightily, a commander, a victor! Oh! 
who should not ascend high mountains to behold such 
growths? 

At thy tree, O Zarathustra, the gloomy and ill-constituted 



THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

also refresh themselves; at thy look even the wavering becomx 
steady and heal their hearts. 

And verily, towards thy mountain and thy tree do many eyes 
turn to-day; a great longing hath arisen, and many have learned 
to ask: Who is Zarathustra? 

And those into whose ears thou hast at any time dripped 
thy song and thy honey: all the hidden ones, the lone-dwellers 
and the twain-dwellers, have simultaneously said to their 
hearts: 

Doth Zarathustra still live? It is no longer worth while to 
live, everything is indifferent, everything is useless: or else 
we must live with Zarathustra! 

Why doth he not come who hath so long announced him 
self? thus do many people ask; hath solitude swallowed him 
up? Or should we perhaps go to him? 

Now doth it come to pass that solitude itself becometh 
fragile and breaketh open, like a grave that breaketh open and 
can no longer hold its dead. Everywhere one seeth resurrected 
ones. 

Now do the waves rise and rise around thy mountain, O 
Zarathustra. And however high be thy height, many of them 
must rise up to thee: thy boat shall not rest much longer on dry 
ground. 

And that we despairing ones have now come into thy cave, 
and already no longer despair: it is but a prognostic and a 
presage that better ones are on the way to thee, 

For they themselves are on the way to thee, the last 
remnant of God among men that is to say, all the men of 
great longing, of great loathing, of great satiety, 

All who do not want to live unless they learn again to 
hope unless they learn from thee. O Zarathustra, the great 
hope!" 



THE GREETING 315 

Thus spake the king on the right, and seized the hand of 
Zarathustra in order to kiss it; but Zarathustra checked his 
veneration, and stepped back frightened, fleeing as it were, 
silently and suddenly into the far distance. After a little while, 
however, he was again at home with his guests, looked at 
them with clear scrutinising eyes, and said: 

"My guests, ye higher men, I will speak plain language and 
plainly with you. It is not for you that I have waited here in 
these mountains." 

(" Plain language and plainly? Good God!" said here the 
king on the left to himself; "one seeth he doth not know the 
good Occidentals, this sage out of the Orient! 

But he meaneth blunt language and bluntly well! That 
is not the worst taste in these days!" ) 

"Ye may, verily, all of you be higher men," continued Zara 
thustra; "but for me ye are neither high enough, nor strong 
enough. 

For me, that is to say, for the inexorable wh/ch is now silent 
in me, but will not always be silent. And if ye appertain to me, 
still it is not as my right arm. 

For he who himself standeth, like you&gt; on sickly and tender 
legs, wisheth above all to be treated indulgently, whether he be 
conscious of it or hide it from himself. 

My arms and my legs, however, I do not treat indulgently, 
/ do not treat my warriors indulgently: how then could ye be 
iit for m y warfare? 

With you I should spoil all my victories. And many of you 
would tumble over if ye but heard the loud beating of my 
drums. 

Moreover, ye are not sufficiently beautiful and well-born f o* 
me. I require pure, smooth mirrors for my uuctrines; on you* 
mine own likenesf is distorted. 



316 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

On your shoulders presseth many a burden, many a recol 
lection; many a mischievous dwarf squatteth in your corners* 
There is concealed populace also in you. 

And though ye be high and of a higher type, much in you 
is crooked and misshapen. There is no smith in the world that 
could hammer you right and straight for me. 

Ye are only bridges: may higher ones pass over upon you! 
Ye signify steps: so do not upbraid him who ascendeth beyond 
you into his height! 

Out of your seed there may one day arise for me a genuine 
son and perfect heir: but that time is distant. Ye yourselves 
are not those unto whom my heritage and name belong. 

Not for you do I wait here in these mountains; not with you 
may 1 descend for the last time. Ye have come unto me only 
as a presage that higher ones are on the way to me, 

Not 4 the men of great longing, of great loathing, of great 
satiety, and that which ye call the remnant of God; 

Nay! Nay! Three times Nay! For others do I wait here 
in these mountains, and will not lift my foot from thence 
without them; 

For higher ones, stronger ones, triumphanter ones, 
merrier ones, for such as are built squarely in body and soul : 
laughing lions must come! 

O my guests, ye strange ones have ye yet heard nothing of 
my children? And that they are on the way to me? 

Do speak unto me of my gardens, of my Happy Isles, of my 
new beautiful race why do ye not speak unto me thereof? 

This guests -present do I solicit of your love, that ye speaK 
unco me of my children. For them am I rich, for them I became 
poor: what have I not surrendered. 

What would I not surrender tnat I might have one thing 



THE SUPPER 317 

these children, this living plantation, these life-trees of my 
will and of my highest hope!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra, and stopped suddenly in his dis 
course: for his longing came over him, and he closed his eyes 
and his mouth, because of the agitation of his heart. And all 
his guests also were silent, and stood still and confounded: 
except only that the old soothsayer made signs with his hand* 
acd his gestures. 



72. The Supper 

FOR at this point the soothsayer interrupted the greeting of 
Zarathustra and his guests : he pressed forward as one who had 
no time to lose, seized Zarathustra s hand and exclaimed: "But 
Zarathustra! 

One thing is more necessary than the other, so sayest thou 
thyself: well, one thing is now more necessary unto me than 
all others. 

A word at the right time: didst thou not invite me to table? 
And here are many who have made long journeys. Thou dost 
not mean to feed us merely with discourses? 

Besides, all of you have thought too much about freezing, 
drowning, suffocating, and other bodily dangers : none of you, 
however, have thought of my danger, namely, perishing ot 
hunger 

(Thus spake the soothsayer. When Zarathustra s animals, 
however, heard these words, they ran away in terror. For they 
saw that all they had brought home during the day would not 
be enough to fill the one soothsayer. ) 

"Likewise perishing of thirst," continued the soothsayer. 
"Arid although I hear water splashing here like words of wis- 



318 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

dom that is to say, plenteously and unweariedly, I wan* 
wine! 

Not every one is a born water-drinker like Zarathustra, 
Neither d^h water suit weary and withered ones: we deserve 
wine // alone giveth immediate vigour and improvised 
health!" 

On this occasion, when the soothsayer was longing for wine, 
it happened that the king on the left, the silent one, also found 
expression for once. "We took care," said he, "about wine, I, 
along with my brother the king on the right: we have enough 
of wine, a whole ass-load of it. So there is nothing lacking 
but bread." 

"Bread." replied Zarathustra, laughing when he spake, "it 
is precisely bread that anchorites have not. But man doth not 
live by bread alone, but also by the flesh of good lambs, of 
which I have two: 

These shall we slaughter quickly, and cook spicily with 
sage: it is so that I like them. And there is also no lack of 
roots and fruits, good enough even for the fastidious and 
dainty, nor of nuts and other riddles for cracking. 

Thus will we have a good repast in a little while. But who 
ever wisheth to eat with us must also give a hand to the work, 
even the kings. For with Zarathustra even a king may be a 
cook." 

This proposal appealed to the hearts of all of them, save 
that the voluntary beggar objected to the flesh and wine and 
spices. 

"Just hear this glutton Zarathustra!" said he jokingly: "doth 
one go into caves and high mountains to make such repasts? 

Now indeed do I understand what he once taught us: 
Blessed be moderate poverty! And why he wisheth to dc 
away with beggars." 



THE HIGHER MAN 319 

"Be of good cheer," replied Zarathustra, "as I am. Abide 
by thy customs, thou excellent one: grind thy corn, drink thy 
water, praise thy cooking, if only it make thee glad! 

I am a law only for mine own; I am not a law for all. He, 
however, who belongeth unto me must be strong of bone and 
light of foot, 

Joyous in fight and feast, no sulker, no John o Dreams, 
ready for the hardest task as for the feast, healthy and hale. 

The best belongeth unto mine and me; and if it be not given 
us, then do we take it: the best food, the purest sky, the 
strongest thoughts, the fairest women!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra; the king on the right however 
answered and said: "Strange! Did one ever hear such sensible 
things out of the mouth of a wise man? 

And verily, it is the strangest thing in a wise man, if over 
and above, he be still sensible, and not an ass." 

Thus spake the king on the right and wondered; the ass 
however, with ill-will, said YE-A to his remark. This however 
was the beginning of that long repast which is called "The 
Supper" in the history-books. At this there was nothing else 
spoken of but the higher man. 



The Higher Man 



WHEN I came unto men for the first time, then did I commit 
the anchorite folly, the great folly: I appeared on the market 
place. 



32O THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

And when I spake unto all, I spake unto none. In the eve 
ning, however, rope-dancers were my companions, and 
corpses; and I myself almost a corpse. 

With the new morning, however, there came unto me a new 
Truth: then did I learn to say: "Of what account to me are 
market-place and populace and populace-noise and long popu 
lace-cars!" 

Ye higher men, learn this from me: On the market-place no 
one believeth in higher men. But if ye will speak there, very 
well! The populace, however, blinketh: "We are all equal." 

"Ye higher men," so blinketh the populace "there are 
no higher men, we are all equal; man is man, before God 
we are all equal!" 

Before God! Now, however, this God hath died. Before 
the populace, however, we will not be equal. Ye higher men, 
away from the market-place! 



2 



Before God! Now however this God hath died! Ye higher 
men, this God was your greatest danger. 

Only since he lay in the grave have ye again arisen. Now 
only cometh the great noontide, now only doth the higher 
man become master! 

Have ye understood this word, O my brethren? Ye are 
frightened: do your hearts turn giddy? Doth the abyss here 
yawn for you? Doth the hell-hound here yelp at you? 

Well! Take heart! ye higher men! Now only travaileth the 
mountain of the human future. God hath died: now do wt 
desire the Superman to live. 



THE HIGHER MAN 321 

3 



The most careful ask to-day: "How is man to be main 
tained?" Zarathustra however asketh, as the first and only one: 
"How is man to be surpassed?" 

The Superman, I have at heart; that is the first and only thing 
to me and not man: not the neighbour, not the poorest, not 
the sorriest, not the best. 

O my brethren, what I can love in man is that he is an over 
going and a down-going. And also in you there is much that 
maketh me love and hope. 

In that ye have despised, ye higher men, that maketh me 
hope. For the great despisers are the great reverers. 

In that ye have despaired, there is much to honour. For ye 
have not learned to submit yourselves, ye have not learned 
petty policy. 

For to-day have the petty people become master: they all 
preach submission and humility and policy and diligence and 
consideration and the long et cetera of petty virtues. 

Whatever is of the effeminate type, whatever originateth 
from the servile type, and especially the populace-mishmash: 
that wisheth now to be master of all human destiny O 
disgust! Disgust! Disgust! 

That asketh and asketh and never tireth: "How is man to 
maintain himself best, longest, most pleasantly?" Thereby 
are they the masters of today. 

These masters of today surpass them, O my brethren 
these petty people: they are the Superman s greatest danger! 

Surpass, ye higher men, the petty virtues, the petty policy s 
the sand-grain considerateness, the ant-hill trumpery, the pitr 



322 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

able comfortableness, the "happiness of the greatest num 
ber ! 

And rather despair than submit yourselves. And verily, I 
love you, because ye know not today how to live, ye higher 
men! For thus do ye live best! 



Have ye courage, O my brethren? Are ye stout-hearted? Not 
the courage before witnesses, but anchorite and eagle courage, 
which not even a God any longer beholdeth? 

Cold souls, mules, the blind and the drunken, I do not call 
stout-hearted. He hath heart who knoweth fear, but vanquish- 
eth it; who seeth the abyss, but with pride. 

He who seeth the abyss, but with eagle s eyes, he who with 
eagle s talons grasp eth the abyss: he hath courage. 



"Man is evil" so said to me for consolation, all the wisest 
ones. Ah, if only it be still true today! For the evil is man s 
best force. 

"Man must become better and eviler" so do 7 teach. The 
evilest is necessary for the Superman s best. 

It may have been well for the preacher of the petty people 
to suffer and be burdened by men s sin. I, however, rejoice in 
great sin as my great consolation 

Such things, however, are not said for long ears. Every word, 
also, is not suited for every mouth. These are fine far-away 
things: at them sheep s claws shall not grasp! 



THE HIGHER MAN 323 



Ye higher men, think ye that I am here to put right what ye 
have put wrong? 

Or that I wished henceforth to make snugger couches for 
you sufferers? Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimb- 
ing ones, new and easier footpaths? 

Nay! Nay! Three times Nay! Always more, always bettet 
ones of your type shall succumb, for ye shall always have it 
worse and harder. Thus only 

Thus only groweth man aloft to the height where the 
lightning striketh and shattereth him: high enough for the 
lightning! 

Towards the few, the long, the remote go forth my soul and 
my seeking: of what account to me are your many little, short 
miseries! 

Ye do not yet suffer enough for me! For ye suffer from your 
selves, ye have not yet suffered from man. Ye would lie if yd 
spake otherwise! None of you suffereth from what I have suf * 
fered, 



It is not enough for me that the lightning no longer doetb 
harm. I do not wish to conduct it away: it shall learn to work 
for me. 

My wisdom hath accumulated long like a cloud, it becometh 
stiller and darker. So doeth all wisdom which shah one day 
bear lightnings. 



324 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Unto these men of today will I not be light, nor be called 
light. Them will I blind: lightning of my wisdom! put out 
their eyes!

Do not will anything beyond your power: there is a bad 
falseness in those who will beyond their power. 

Especially when they will great things! For they awaken 
distrust in great things, these subtle false-coiners and stage- 
players: 

Until at last they are false towards themselves, squint- 
eyed, whited cankers, glossed over with strong words, parade 
virtues and brilliant false deeds. 

Take good care there, ye higher men! For nothing is more 
precious to me, and rarer, than honesty. 

Is this today not that of the populace? The populace how 
ever knoweth not what is great and what is small, what is 
straight and what is honest: it is innocently crooked, it ever 
lieth. 



Have a good distrust today, ye higher men, ye enheartened 
ones! Ye open-hearted ones! And keep your reasons secret! For 
this today is that of the populace. 

What the populace once learned to believe without reasons, 
who could refute it to them by means of reasons? 

And on the market-place one convinceth with gestures. But 
reasons make the populace distrustful. 

And when truth hath once triumphed there, then ask your- 



THE HIGHER MAN 325 

selves with good distrust: "What strong error hath fought 
for it?" 

Be on your guard also against the learned! They hate you, 
because they are unproductive! They have cold, withered eyes 
before which every bird is unplumed. 

Such persons vaunt about not lying: but inability to lie is 
still far from being love to truth. Be on your guard! 

Freedom from fever is still far from being knowledge! 
Refrigerated spirits I do not believe in. He who cannot lie, 
doth not know what truth is. 



10 



If ye would go up high, then use your own legs! Do not get 
yourselves carried aloft; do not seat yourselves on other peo 
ple s backs and heads! 

Thou hast mounted, however, on horseback? Thou now 
ridest briskly up to thy goal? Well, my friend! But thy lame 
foot is also with thee on horseback! 

When thou readiest thy goal, when thou alightest from thy 
horse: precisely on thy height, thou higher man, then wilt 
thou stumble! 



11 

Ye creating ones, ye higher men! One is only pregnant with 
one s own child. 

Do not let yourselves be imposed upon or put upon! Who 
then is your neighbour? Even if ye act "for your neighbour" 
ve still do not create for him! 



326 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Unlearn, I pray you, this "for," ye creating ones: your very 
virtue wisheth you to have naught to do with "for" and "on 
Jxcount of" and "because." Against these false little words 
shall ye stop your ears. 

"For one s neighbour," is the virtue only of the petty people : 
ihere it is said "like and like," and "hand washeth hand": 
they have neicher the right nor the power for your self-seeking: 

In your self-seeking, ye creating ones, there is the foresight 
and foreseeing of the pregnant! What no one s eye hath yet 
seen, namely, the fruit this, sheltereth and saveth and nour- 
isheth your entire love. 

Where your entire love is, namely, with your child, there is 
also your entire virtue! Your work, your will is your "neigh* 
bour": let no false values impose upon you! 



12 



Ye creating ones, ye higher men! Whoever hath to give birth 
is sick; whoever hath given birth, however, is unclean. 

Ask women: one giveth birth, not because it giveth pleas 
ure. The pain maketh hens and poets cackle. 

Ye creating ones, in you there is much uncleanness. That is 
because ye have had to be mothers. 

A new child : oh, how much new filth hath also come into 
the world! Go apart! He who hath given birth shall wash his 
soul! 



13 



Be not virtuous beyond your powers! And seek nothing from 
yourselves opposed to probability! 



THE HIGHER MAN 327 

Walk in the footsteps in which your fathers virtue hath 
already walked! How would ye rise high, if your fathers will 
should not rise with you? 

He, however, who would be a firstling, let him take care lest 
he also become a lastling! And where the vices of your fathers 
are, there should ye not set up as saints! 

He whose fathers were inclined for women, and for strong 
wine and flesh of wildboar swine; what would it be if he 
demanded chastity of himself? 

A folly would it be! Much, verily, doth it seem to me for 
such a one, if he should be the husband of one or of two or of 
three women. 

And if he founded monasteries, and inscribed over their 
portals: "The way to holiness," I should still say: What good 
is it! it is a new folly! 

He hath founded for himself a penance-house and refuge- 
house: much good may it do! But I do not believe in it. 

In solitude there groweth what any one bringeth into it 
also the brute in one s nature. Thus is solitude inadvisable unto 
many. 

Hath there ever been anything filthier on earth than the 
saints of the wilderness? Around them was not only the devil 
loose but also the swine. 



Shy, ashamed, awkward, like the tiger whose spring hath 
failed thus, ye higher men, have I often seen you slink aside. 
A cast which ye made had failed. 

But what doth it matter, ye dice-players! Ye had not learned 



328 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

20 play and mock, as one must play and mock! Do we not ever 
sit at a great table of mocking and playing? 

And if great things have been a failure with you, have ye 
yourselves therefore been a failure? And if ye yourselves 
have been a failure, hath man therefore been a failure? 
If man, however, hath been a failure: well then! never 
mind! 



15 



The higher its type, always the seldomer doth a thing suc 
ceed. Ye higher men here, have ye not all been failures? 

Be of good cheer; what doth it matter? How much is still 
possible! Learn to laugh at yourselves, as ye ought to 
laugh! 

What wonder even that ye have failed and only half-suc 
ceeded, ye half-shattered ones! Doth not man s future strive 
and struggle in you? 

Man s furthest, profoundest, star-highest issues, his prodi 
gious powers do not all these foam through one another in 
your vessel? 

What wonder that many a vessel shattereth! Learn to laugh 
at yourselves, as ye ought to laugh! Ye higher men, Oh, how 
much is still possible! 

And verily, how much hath already succeeded! How rich is 
this earth in small, good, perfect things, in well-constituted 
things! 

Set around you small, good, perfect things, ye higher men. 
Their golden maturity healeth the heart. The perfect teacheth 
one to hope. 



THE HIGHER MAN 329 

16 



What hath hitherto been the greatest sin here on earth? Was 
it not the word of him who said: "Woe unto them that laugh 
now!" 

Did he himself find no cause for laughter on the earth? 
Then he sought badly. A child even findeth cause for it. 

He did not love sufficiently : otherwise would he also hav* 
loved us, the laughing ones! But he hated and hooted us; wail 
ing and teeth-gnashing did he promise us. 

Must one then curse immediately, when one doth not love? 
That seemeth to me bad taste. Thus did he, however, this 
absolute one. He sprang from the populace. 

And he himself just did not love sufficiently; otherwise 
would he have raged less because people did not love him. All 
great love doth not seek love: it seeketh more. 

Go out of the way of all such absolute ones! They are a poor 
sickly type, a populace-type: they look at this life with ill-will, 
they have an evil eye for this earth. 

Go out of the way of all such absolute ones! They have heavy 
feet and sultry hearts: they do not know how to dance. How 
could the earth be light to such ones! 



Tortuously do ail good things come nigh to their goal. Like 
cats they curve their backs, they purr inwardly with their ap 
proaching happiness, all good things laugh. 

His step betrayeth whether a person already walketh on his 



33 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTirvrt 

own path: just see me walk! He, however, who cometh nigh to 
his goal, danceth. 

And verily, a statue have I not become, not yet do I stand 
there stiff, stupid and stony, like a pillar; I love fast racing. 

And though there be on earth fens and dense afflictions, he 
;vho hath light feet runneth even across the mud, and danceth, 
is upon well-swept ice. 

Lift up your hearts, my brethren, high, higher! And do not 
forget your legs! Lift up also your legs, ye good dancers, and 
better still, if ye stand upon your heads! 



18 



This crown of the laughter, this rose-garland crown : I my 
self have put on this crown, I myself have consecrated my 
faughter. No one else have I found to-day potent enough for 
this. 

Zarathustra the dancer, Zarathustra the light one, who beck- 
oneth with his pinions, one ready for flight, beckoning unto 
all birds, ready and prepared, a blissfully light-spirited one: 

Zarathustra the soothsayer, Zarathustra the sooth-laugher, 
no impatient one, no absolute one, one who loveth leaps arid 
side-leaps; I myself have put on this crown! 



19 



Lift up your hearts, my brethren, high, higher! And do not 
forget your legs! Lift up also your legs, ye good dancers, and 
Detter still if ye stand upon your heady! 



THE HIGHER MAN 331 

There are also heavy animals in a state of happiness, there 
are club-footed ones from the beginning. Curiously do they 
exert themselves, like an elephant which endeavoureth to stand 
upon its head. 

Better, however, to be foolish with happiness than foolish 
with misfortune, better to dance awkwardly than walk lamely. 
So learn, I pray you, my wisdom, ye higher men : even the worst 
thing hath two good reverse sides, 

Even the worst thing hath good dancing-legs: so learn, 
I pray you, ye higher men, to put yourselves on your proper 
legs! 

So unlearn, I pray you, the sorrow-sighing, and all the popu 
lace-sadness! Oh, how sad the buffoons of the populace seem 
to me today! This today, however, is that of the populace. 



20 



Do like unto the wind when it rusheth forth from its moun 
tain-caves: unto its own piping will it dance; the seas tremble 
and leap under its footsteps. 

That which giveth wings to asses, that which milketh the 
lionesses: praised be that good, unruly spirit, which cometh 
like a hurricane unto all the present and unto all the popu 
lace, 

Which is hostile to thistle-heads and puzzle-heads, and to 
all withered leaves and weeds: praised be this wild, good, 
free spirit of the storm, which danceth upon fens ana afflic

Which hateth the consumptive oopulace-dogs, an&lt;-l all the 
ill-constituted, sullen brood: praised be this spirit of ail free 



332 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

spirits, the laughing storm, which bloweth dust into the eyes 
of all the melanopic and melancholic! 

Ye higher men, the worst thing in you is that ye have none 
of you learned to dance as ye ought to dance to dance beyond 
yourselves! What doth it matter that ye have failed! 

How many things are still possible! So learn to laugh be 
yond yourselves! Lift up your hearts, ye good dancers, high! 
higher! And do not forget the good laughter! 

This crown of the laughter, this rose-garland crown: to you, 
my brethren, do I cast this crown! Laughing hasp I consecrated; 
ye higher men, learn, I pray you to laugh! 



. The Song of Melancholy 



WHEN Zarathustra spake these sayings, he stood nigh to the 
entrance of his cave; with the last words, however, he slipped 
away from his guests, and fled for a little while into the open 
air. 

"O pure odours around me," cried he, "O blessed stillness 
around me! But where are mine animals? Hither, hither, mine 
eagle and my serpent! 

Tell me, mine animals : these higher men, all of them do 
they perhaps not smell well? O pure odours around me! Now 
only do I know and feel how I love you, mine animals." 

And Zarathustra said once more: "I love you, mine ani 
mals!" The eagle, however, and the serpent pressed close to 
him when he spake these words, and looked up to him. In this 



THE SONG OF MELANCHOLY 333 

attitude were they all three silent together, and sniffed and 
sipped the good air with one another. For the air here outside 
was better than with the higher men. 



Hardly, however, had Zarathustra left the cave when the 
old magician got up, looked cunningly about him, and said: 
"He is gone! 

And already, ye higher men let me tickle you with this 
complimentary and flattering name, as he himself doeth 
already doth mine evil spirit of deceit and magic attack me, 
my melancholy devil, 

Which is an adversary to this Zarathustra from the very 
heart: forgive it for this! Now doth it wish to conjure before 
you, it hath just its hour; in vain do I struggle with this evil 
spirit. 

Unto all of you, whatever honours ye like to assume in your 
names, whether ye call yourselves the free spirits or the con 
scientious, or the penitents of the spirit, or the unfettered/ 
or the great longers, - 

Unto all of you, who like me suffer from the great loath 
ing, to whom the old God hath died, and as yet no new God 
lieth in cradles and swaddling clothes unto all of you is mine 
evil spirit and magic- devil favourable. 

I know you, ye higher men, I know him, I know also this 
fiend whom I love in spite of me, this Zarathustra: he himself 
often seemeth to me like the beautiful mask of a saint, 

Like a new strange mummery in which mine evil spirit, 
the melancholy devil, delighteth: I love Zarathustra, so doth 
it often seem to me, for the sake of mine evil spirit. 



334 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

But already doth // attack me and constrain me, this spirit of 
melancholy, this evening-twilight devil : and verily, ye higher 
men, it hath a longing 

Open your eyes! it hath a longing to come naked, 
whether male or female, I do not yet know: but it cometh, it 
constraineth me, alas! open your wits! 

The day dieth out, unto all things cometh now the evening, 
also unto the best things; hear now, and see, ye higher men, 
what devil man or woman this spirit of evening-melan 
choly is!" 

Thus spake the old magician, looked cunningly about him, 
then seized his harp.

Are thine own desires neath a thousand guises,

Sunk downwards, evenwards, shadowwards: 
By one sole trueness 
All scorched and thirsty:

. Science 



THUS sang the magician; and all who were present went like 
birds unawares into the net of his artful and melancholy volup 
tuousness. Only the spiritually conscientious one had not been 
caught: he at once snatched the harp from the magician and 
called out: "Air! Let in good air! Let in Zarathustra! Thou 
makest this cave sultry and poisonous, thou bad old magi 



cian! 

Thou seducest, thou false one, thou subtle one, to unknown 
desires and deserts. And alas, that such as thou should talk 
find make ado about the truth! 

Alas, to all free spirits who are not on their guard against 
such magicians! It is all over with their freedom: thou teachest 
and temptest back into prisons, 

Thou old melancholy devil, out of thy lament soundeth 
a lurement: thou resemblest those who with their praise of 
chastity secretly invite to voluptuousness!" 

Thus spake the conscientious one; the old magician, how 
ever, looked about him, enjoying his triumph, and on that 
account put up with the annoyance which the conscientious one 
caused him. "Be still!" said he with modest voice, "good songs 
want to re-echo well; after good songs one should be long 
silent. 

Thus do all those present, the higher men. Thou, however, 
hast perhaps understood but little of my song? In thee there 
is little of the magic spirit." 

; T hou praisest me," replied the conscientious one, "in that 
thou separatest me from thyself; very well! But, ye others, 
what do I see? Ye still sit there, all of you, with lusting eyes : 



SCIENCE 339 

Ye free spirits, whither hath your freedom gone! Ye almost 
seem to me to resemble those who have long looked at bad 
girls dancing naked: your souls themselves dance! 

In you, ye higher men, there must be more of that which the 
magician calleth his evil spirit of magic and deceit: we must 
indeed be different. 

And verily, we spake and thought long enough together ere 
Zarathustra came home to his cave, for me not to be unaware 
that we are different. 

We seek different things even here aloft, ye and I. For I seek 
more security; on that account have I come to Zarathustra. Foi 
he is still the most steadfast tower and will 

Today, when everything tottereth, when all the earth 
quaketh. Ye, however, when I see what eyes ye make, it almost 
seemeth to me that ye seek more insecurity, 

More horror, more danger, more earthquake. Ye long ( it 
almost seemeth so to me forgive my presumption, ye higher 
men) 

Ye long for the worst and dangerousest life, which f right- 
eneth me most, for the life of wild beasts, for forests, caves, 
steep mountains and labyrinthine gorges. 

And it is not those who lead out of danger that please you 
best, but those who lead you away from all paths, the mis- 
leaders. But if such longing in you be actual, it seemeth to me 
nevertheless to be impossible. 

For fear that is man s original and fundamental feeling; 
through fear everything is explained, original sin and original 
virtue. Through fear there grew also my virtue, that is to say: 
Science. 

For fear of wild animals that hath been longest fostered 
in man, inclusive of the animal which he concealeth and fear* 
eth in himself: Zarathustra calleth it the beast inside. 



340 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Such prolonged ancient fear, at last become subtle, spir 
itual and intellectual at present, me thinketh, it is called 
Science." 

Thus spake the conscientious one; but Zarathustra, who had 
just come back into his cave and had heard and divined the last 
discourse, threw a handful of roses to the conscientious one, 
and laughed on account of his "truths." "Why!" he exclaimed, 
"what did I hear just now? Verily, it seemeth to me, thou art a 
fool, or else I myself am one: and quietly and quickly will I 
put thy truth upside down. 

For fear is an exception with us. Courage, however, and 
adventure, and delight in the uncertain, in the unattempted 
courage seemeth to me the entire primitive history of man. 

The wildest and most courageous animals hath he envied 
and robbed of all their virtues : thus only did he become man. 

This courage, at last become subtle, spiritual and intellec 
tual, this human courage, with eagle s pinions and serpent s 
wisdom : this, it seemeth to me, is called at present 

( Zarathustra!" cried all of them there assembled, as if with 
one voice, and burst out at the same time into a great laugh 
ter; there arose, however, from them as it were a heavy cloud. 
Even the magician laughed, and said wisely: "Well! It is gone, 
mine evil spirit! 

And did I not myself warn you against it when I said that 
it was a deceiver, a lying and deceiving spirit? 

Especially when it showeth itself naked. But what can / do 
with regard to its tricks! Have / created it and the world? 

Well! Let us be good again, and of good cheer! And al 
though Zarathustra looketh with evil eye just see him! he 
disliketh me : 

Ere night cometh will he again learn to love and laud me; 
he cannot live long without committing such follies. 



AMONG DAUGHTERS OF THE DESERT 341 

He loveth his enemies: this art knoweth he better than any 
one I have seen. But he taketh revenge for it on his friends!" 

Thus spake the old magician, and the higher men applauded 
him; so that Zarathustra went round, and mischievously and 
lovingly shook hands with his friends, like one who hath to 
make amends and apologise to every one for something. When 
however he had thereby come to the door of his cave, lo, then 
had he again a longing for the good air outside, and for his 
animals, and wished to steal out. 



67. Among Daughters of the Desert 



"Go NOT away!" said then the wanderer who called himself 
Zarathustra s shadow, "abide with us otherwise the old 
gloomy affliction might again fall upon us. 

Now hath that old magician given us of his worst for oui 
gcod, and lo! the good, pious pope there hath tears in his eyes, 
and hath quite embarked again upon the sea of melancholy. 

Those kings may well put on a good air before us still : for 
that have they learned best of us all at present! Had they how* 
ever no one to see them, I wager that with them also the bad 
game would again commence, 

The bad game of drifting clouds, of damp melancholy, 
of curtained heavens, of stolen suns, of howling autumn- 
winds, 

The bad gzme of our howling and crying for help! Abide 
with us, O Zarathustra! Here there is much concealed misery 



342 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

that wisheth to speak, much evening, much cloud, n .ch damp 
air! 

Thou hast nourished us with strong food for men, and 
powerful proverbs: do not let the weakly, womanly spirits 
attack us anew at dessert! 

Thou alone makest the air around thee strong and clear. Did 
1 ever find anywhere on earth such good air as with thee in thy 
cave? 

Many lands have I seen, my nose hath learned to test and 
estimate many kinds of air: but with thee do my nostrils taste 
their greatest delight! 

Unless it be, unless it be , do forgive an old recollection! 
Forgive me an old after-dinner song, which I once composed 
amongst daughters of the desert: 

For with them was there equally good, clear, Oriental air: 
there was I furthest from cloudy, damp, melancholy Old- 
Europe! 

Then did I love such Oriental maidens and other blue king 
doms of heaven, over which hang no clouds and no thoughts. 

Ye would not believe how charmingly they sat there, when, 
they did not dance, profound, but without thoughts, like little 
secrets, like beribboned riddles, like dessert-nuts 

Many-hued and foreign, forsooth! but without clouds: rid 
dles which can be guessed: to please such maidens I then 
composed an after-dinner psalm." 

Thus spake the wanderer who called himself Zarathustra s 
shadow; and before any one answered him, he had seized the 
harp of the old magician, crossed his legs, and looked calmly 
and sagely around him: with his nostrils, however, he in 
haled the air slowly and questioningly, like one who in new 
countries tasteth new foreign air. Afterward he began to sing 
with a kind of roaring.

. The Awakening 



AFTER the song of the wanderer and shadow, the cave became 
all at once full of noise and laughter: and since the assembled 
guests all spake simultaneously, and even the ass, encouraged 
thereby, no longer remained silent, a little aversion and scorn 
for his visitors came over Zarathustra, although he rejoiced at 
their gladness. For it seemed to him a sign of convalescence. 
So he slipped out into the open air and spake to his animals. 

"Whither hath their distress now gone?" said he, and 
already did he himself feel relieved of his petty disgust 
"with me, it seemeth that they have unlearned their cries of 
distress! 

Though, alas! not yet their crying." And Zarathustra 
stopped his ears, for just then did the YE-A of the ass mix 
strangely with the noisy jubilation of those higher men. 

"They are merry," he began again, "and who knoweth? 
perhaps at their host s expense; and if they have learned of me 
to laugh, still it is not my laughter they have learned. 

But what matter about that! They are old people: they re 
cover in their own way, they laugh in their own way; mine ears 
have already endured worse and have not become peevish. 

This day is a victory: he already yieldeth, he fleeth, the spirit 
of gravity, mine old arch-enemy! How well this day is about te 
end, which began so badly and gloomily! 

And it is about to end. Already cometh the evening: over 
the sea rideth it hither, the good rider! How it bobbeth, the 
blessed one, the home- returning one, in its purple saddles! 



THE AWAKENING 349 

The sky gazeth brightly thereon, the world lieth deep. Oh r 
all ye strange ones who have come to me, it is already worth 
a/hile to have lived with me!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra. And again came the cries anc* 
laughter of the higher men out of the cave: then began he 
anew: 

They bite at it, my bait taketh, there departeth also from 
them their enemy, the spirit of gravity. Now do they learn to 
laugh at themselves: do I hear rightly? 

My virile food taketh effect, my strong and savoury sayings : 
and verily, I did not nourish them with flatulent vegetables! 
But with warrior-food, with conqueror-food : new desires did 
I awaken. 

New hopes are in their arms and legs, their hearts expand. 
They find new words, soon will their spirits breathe wanton 
ness. 

Such food may sure enough not be proper for children, nor 
even for longing girls old and young. One persuadeth their 
bowels otherwise; I am not their physician and teacher. 

The disgust departeth from these higher men; well! that is 
my victory. In my domain they become assured; all stupid 
shame fleeth away; they empty themselves. 

They empty their hearts, good times return unto them, they 
keep holiday and ruminate, they become thankful. 

That do I take as the best sign: they become thankful. Not 
long will it be ere they devise festivals, and put up memorials 
to their old joys. 

They are convalescents!" Thus spake Zarathustra joyfullv 
to his heart and gazed outward; his animals, however, pressed 
up to him, and honoured his happiness and his silence. 



THUS PAKE ZARATHUSTRA

All on a sudden however, Zarathustra s ear was frightened 
for the cave which had hitherto been full of noise and laugh 
ter, became all at once still as death; his nose, however, smel 
a sweet-scented vapour and incense-odour, as if from burning 
pine-cones. 

"What happeneth? What are they about?" he asked himself, 
And stole nrr tc the entrance, that he might be able unobserved 
to see his guests. But wonder upon wonder! what was he then 
obliged to behold with his own eyes! 

"They have all of them become pious again, they pray, they 
are mad!" said he, and was astonished beyond measure. And 
forsooth! all these higher men, the two kings, the pope out of 
service, the evil magician, the voluntary beggar, the wanderer 
and shadow, the old soothsayer, the spiritually conscientious 
one, and the ugliest man they all lay on their knees like chil 
dren and credulous old women, and worshipped the ass. And 
just then began the ugliest man to gurgle and snort, as if some 
thing unutterable in him tried to find expression; when, how 
ever, he had actually found words, behold! it was a pious 
strange litany in praise of the adored and censed ass. And the 
litany sounded thus: 

Amen! And glory and honour and wisdom and thanks anc* 
praise and strength be to our God, from everlasting to ever 
lasting! 

The ass, however, here brayed YE -A. 

He carried our burdens, he hath taken upon him the forrr 
of a servant, he is patient of heart and never saith Nav; and h* 
who loveth his God chastiserh him. 



THE AWAKENING 351 

The ass, however, here brayed YE -A. 

He speaketh not: except that he ever saith Yea to the worlo! 
vhich he created: thus doth he extol his world. It is his artful- 
less that speaketh not: thus is he rarely found wrong. 

The ass, however, here brayed YE -A. 

Uncomely goeth he through the world. Grey is the favourite 
colour in which he wrappeth his virtue. Hath he spirit, then 
doth he conceal it; every one, however, believeth in his long 
ears. 

The ass, however, here brayed YE-A. 

What hidden wisdom it is to wear long ears, and only to say 
Yea and never Nay! Hath he not created the world in his own 
image, namely, as stupid as possible? 
The ass, however, here brayed YE-A. 

Thou goest straight and crooked ways 1 ; it concerneth thee 
little what seemeth straight or crooked unto us men. Beyond 
good and evil is thy domain. It is thine innocence not to know 
vhat innocence is. 

The ass, however, here brayed YE-A. 

Lo! how thou spurnest none from thee, neither beggars nor 
kings. Thou sufferest ,-itle children to come unto thee, and 
when the bad boys decoy thee, theii sayest thou simply, YE-A. 
The ass, however, here brayed YE-A. 

Thou lovest she-asses and fresh figs, thou art no food- 
iespiser. A thistle tickleth thy heart when thou chancest to be 
hungry. There is the wisdom of a God therein. 

The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.

78. The Ass-Festival 



*iT THIS place in the litany, however, Zarathustra could nc 
longer control himself; he himself cried out YE-A, louder even 
than the ass, and sprang into the midst of his maddened guests. 
"Whatever are you about, ye grown-up children? he ex 
claimed, pulling up the praying ones from the ground. "Alas, 
if any one else, except Zarathustra, had seen you : 

Every one would think you the worst blasphemers, or the 
very foolishest old women, with your new belief! 

And thou thyself, thou old pope, how is it in accordance 
with thee, to adore an ass in such a manner as God?" 

"O Zarathustra," answered the pope, "forgive me, but in 
divine matters I am more enlightened even than thou. And it 
is right that it should be so. 

Better to adore God so, in this form, than in no form at all.! 
Think over this saying, mine exalted friend: thou wilt readily 
divine that in such a saying there is wisdom. 

He who said God is a Spirit made the greatest stride and 
slide hitherto made on earth towards unbelief: such a dictum 
is not easily amended again on earth! 

Mine old heart leapeth and boundeth because there is still 
something to adore on earth. Forgive it, O Zarathustra, to an 
old, pious pontiff-heart! 

-"And thou," said Zarathustra to the wanderer and 
shadow, "thou callest and thinkest thyself a free spirit? And 
thou here practisest such idolatry and hierolatry? 



THE ASS-FESTIVAL 353 

Worse verily, doest thou here than with thy bad brown girls, 
thou bad, new believer!" 

"It is sad enough," answered the wanderer and shadow, 
"thou art right: but how can I help it! The old God liveth 
again, O Zarathustra, thou mayst say what thou wilt. 

The ugliest man is to blame for it all : he hath reawakened 
him. And if he say that he once killed him, with Gods death 
is always just a prejudice." 

-"And thou," said Zarathustra, "thou bad old magician, 
what didst thou do! Who ought to believe any longer in thee 
in this free age, when thou believest in such divine donkeyism? 

It was a stupid thing that chou didst; how couldst thou, a 
shrewd man, do such a stupid thing!" 

"O Zarathustra," answered the shrewd magician, "thou art 
right, it was a stupid thing, it was also repugnant to me." 

"And thou even," said Zarathustra to the spiritually con 
scientious one, "consider, and put thy finger to thy nose! Doth 
nothing go against thy conscience here? Is thy spirit not too 
cleanly for this praying and the fumes of those devotees?" 

"There is something therein," said the spiritually conscien 
tious one, and put his finger to his nose, "there is something in 
this spectacle which even doeth good to my conscience. 

Perhaps I dare not believe in God : certain it is however, that 
God seemeth to me most worthy of belief in this form. 

God is said to be eternal, according to the testimony of the 
most pious : he who hath so much time taketh his time. As slow 
and as stupid as possible: thereby can such a one nevertheless 
go very far. 

And he who hath too much spirit might well become infatu 
ated with stupidity and folly. Think of thyself, O Zarathustra! 

Thou thyself verily! even thou couldst well become an 
ass through superabundance of wisdom.

Doth not the true sago willingly walk on the crookedest 
paths? The evidence teacheth it, O Zarathustra, thine own 
evidence!" 

-"And thou thyself, finally/ said Zarathustra, and turned 
towards the ugliest man, who still lay on the ground stretch 
ing up his arm to the ass (for he gave it wine to drink) . "Say, 
thou nondescript, what hast thou been about! 

Thou seemest to me transformed, thine eyes glow, the man- 
de of the sublime covereth thine ugliness: what didst thou do? 

Is it then true what they say, that thou hast again awakened 
him? And why? Was he not tor good reasons killed and made 
away with? 

Thou thyself seemest to me awakened: what didst thou do? 
why didst thou turn round? Why didst thou get converted? 
Speak, thou nondescript!" 

"O Zarathustra," answered the ugliest man, "thou art a 
rogue! 

Whether he yet liveth, or again liveth, or is thoroughly dead 
which of us both knoweth that best? I ask thee. 

One thing however do I know, from thyself did I learn it 
once, O Zarathustra: he who wanteth to kill most thoroughly, 
laugh eth. 

Not by wrath but by laughter doth one kill thus spakest 
thou once, O Zarathustra, thou hidden one, thou destroyer 
without wrath, thou dangerous saint, thou art a rogue!" 



Then, however, did it come to pass that Zarathustra, aston 
!hed at such merely roguish answers, jumped back to the door 



THU ASS-FESTIVAL 355 

of his cave, and turning towards all his guests, cried out with 
a strong voice: 

"O ye wags, all of you, ye buffoons! Why do ye dissemble 
and disguise yourselves before me! 

How the hearts of all of you convulsed with delight and 
wickedness, because ye had at last become again like little 
children namely, pious, 

Because ye at last did again as children do namely, 
prayed, folded your hands and said good God ! 

But now leave, I pray you, this nursery, mine own cave, 
where today all childishness is carried on. Cool down, here 
outside, your hot child- wantonness and heart-tumult! 

To be sure: except ye become as little children ye shall not 
enter into that kingdom of heaven." (And Zarathustra pointed 
aloft with his hands.) 

"But we do not at all want to enter into the kingdom of 
heaven: we have become men, so we want the kingdom of 
earth." 



And once more began Zarathustra to speak. "O my new 
friends," said he, "ye strange ones, ye higher men, how well 
do ye now please me, 

Since ye have again become joyful! Ye have, verily, all 
blossomed forth : it seemeth to me that for such flowers as you, 
new festivals are required. 

A little valiant nonsense, some divine service and ass 
festival, some old joyful Zarathustra fool, some blusterer tji 
blow your souls bright. 



356 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

Fcrget not this night and this ass-festival, ye higher men! 
That did ye devise when with me, that do I take as a good 
omen, such things only the convalescents devise! 

And should ye celebrate it again, this ass-festival, do it from 
love to yourselves, do it also from love to me! And in remem 
brance of me!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra. 



The Drunken Song 



MEANWHILE one after another had gone out into the open air, 
and into the cool, thoughtful night; Zarathustra himself, how 
ever, led the ugliest man by the hand, that he might show him 
his night-world, and the great round moon, and the silvery 
water-falls near his cave. There they at last stood still beside 
one another; all of them old people, but with comforted, brave 
hearts, and astonished in themselves that it was so well with 
them on earth; the mystery of the night, however, came nighcr 
and nigher to their hearts. And anew Zarathustra thought to 
himself: "Oh, how well do they now please me, these higher 
men!" but he did not say it aloud, for he respected their 
happiness and their silence. 

Then, however, there happened that which in this astonish 
ing long day was most astonishing: the ugliest man began once 
more and for the last time to gurgle and snort, and when he 



THE DRUNKEN SONG 357 

at length found expression, behold! there sprang a ques 
tion plump and plain out of his mouth, a good, deep, clear 
question, which moved the hearts of all who listened to him. 

"My friends, all of you," said the ugliest man, "what thinK 
ye? For the sake of this day / am for the first time content to 
have lived mine entire life. 

And that I testify so much is still not enough for me. It 
is worth while living on the earth : one day, one festival with 
Zarathustra, hath taught me to love the earth. 

Was that life? will I say unto death. Well! Once 
more! 

My friends, what think ye? Will ye not, like me, say unto 
death: Was that life? For the sake of Zarathustra, well! 
Once more! " 

Thus spake the ugliest man; it was not, however, far from 
midnight. And what took place then, think ye? As soon as the 
higher men heard his question, they became all at once con 
scious of their transformation and convalescence, and of him 
who was the cause thereof : then did they rush up to Zarathus 
tra, thanking, honouring, caressing him, and kissing his hands, 
each in his own peculiar way; so that some laughed and some 
wept. The old soothsayer, however, danced with delight; and. 
though he was then, as some narrators suppose, full of sweet 
wine, he was certainly still fuller of sweet life, and had re 
nounced all weariness. There are even those who narrate that 
the ass then danced: for not in vain had the ugliest man previ 
ously given it wine to drink. That may be the case, or it may be 
otherwise; and if in truth the ass did not dance that evening, 
there nevertheless happened then greater and rarer wonders 
than the dancing of an ass would have been. In short, as the 
proverb of Zarathustra saith: "What doth it matter!" 



358 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 



When, however, this took place with the ugliest man, Zara 
diusura stood there like one drunken: his glance dulled, his 
tongue faltered and his feet staggered. And who could divine 
what thoughts then passed through Zarathustra s soul? Ap 
parently, however, his spirit retreated and fled in advance and 
was in remote distances, and as it were "wandering on high 
mountain-ridges," as it standeth written, " twixt two seas, 

Wandering twixt the past and the future as a heavy 
cloud." Gradually, however, while the higher men held him 
in their arms, he came back to himself a little, and resisted 
with his hands the crowd of the honouring and caring ones; 
but he did not speak. All at once, however, he turned his head 
quickly, for he seemed to hear something: then laid he his 
finger on his mouth and said: "Come!" 

And immediately it became still and mysterious round 
about; from the depth however there came up slowly the sound 
of a clock-bell. Zarathustra listened thereto, like the higher 
men; then, however, laid he his ringer on his mouth the second 
time, and said again: "Come! Come! It is getting on to mid 
night!" and his voice had changed. But still he had not 
moved from the spot. Then it became yet stiller and more mys 
terious, and everything hearkened, even the ass, and Zarathus 
tra s noble r.njmals, the eagle and the serpent, likewise the 
cave of Zarathustra an d the big cool moon, and the night itself. 
Zarathustra, however, laid his hand upon his mouth for the 
third time, and said: 

Come! Come! Come! Let us now wander! It is the now, 
let us wander into the night! 



THE DRUNKEN SONG

L e higher men, it is getting on to midnight: then will I say 
something into your ears, as that old clock-bell saith it into 
mine ear, 

As mysteriously, as frightfully, and as cordially as that 
midnight clock-bell speaketh it to me, which hath experienced 
more than one man: 

Which hath already counted the smarting throbbings of 
your fathers hearts ah! ah! how it sigheth! how it laugheth 
in its dream! the old, deep, deep midnight! 

Hush! Hush! Then is there many a thing heard which may 
not be heard by day; now however, in the cool air, when even 
all the tumult of your hearts hath become still, 

Now doth it speak, now is it heard, now doth it steal into 
overwakeful, nocturnal souls: ah! ah! how the midnight sigh 
eth! how it laugheth in its dream! 

Hearest thou not how it mysteriously, frightfully, and 
cordially speaketh unto thee, the old deep, deep midnight? 
O man, take heed! 



Woe to me! Whither hath time gone? Have I not sunk into 
deep wells? The world sleepeth 

Ah! Ah! The dog howleth, the moon shineth. Rather will 1 
die, rather will I die, than say unto you what my midnight- 
heart now thinketh. 

Already have I died. It is all over. Spider, why spinnest thou 
around me? Wilt thou have blood? Ah! Ah! The dew falleth, 
tht hour cometh 



560 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

The hour in which I frost and freeze, which asketh anc 
asketh and asketh: "Who hath sufficient courage for it? 

Who is to be master of the world? Who is going to say: 
Thus shall ye flow, ye great and small streams!" 

The hour approacheth: O man, thou higher man, take 
heed! this talk is for fine ears, for thine ears what saith deep 
midnight s voice indeed? 



It carrieth me away, my soul danceth. Day s-work! Day s- 
work! Who is to be master of the world: 

The moon is cool, the wind is still. Ah! Ah! Have ye already 
flown high enough? Ye have danced: a leg, nevertheless, is not 
a wing. 

Ye good dancers, now is all delight over: wine hath become 
lees, every cup hath become brittle, the sepulchres mutter. 

Ye have not flown high enough : now do the sepulchres mut 
ter: "Free the dead! Why is it so long night? Doth not the 
moon make us drunken?" 

Ye higher men, free the sepulchres, awaken the corpses! 
Ah, why doth the worm still burrow? There approacheth, 
there approacheth, the hour, 

There boometh the clock-bell, there thrilleth still the 
heart, there burroweth still the wood-worm, the heart- worm. 
Ah! Ah! The world is deep! 



Sweet lyre! Sweet lyre! I love thy tone, thy drunken, ranun 
culine tone! how long, how far hath come unto me thv cone 
from the distance, from the oonds of love! 



THE DRUNKEN SONG 361 

Thou old clock-bell, thou sweet lyre! Every pain hath torn 
thy heart, father-pain, fathers -pain, forefathers -pain; thy 
speech hath become ripe, 

Ripe like the golden autumn and the afternoon, like mine 
anchorite heart new sayest thou: The world itself hath be 
come ripe, the grape turneth brown, 

Now doth it wish to die, to die of happiness. Ye higher 
men, do ye not feel it? There welleth up mysteriously an odour, 

A perfume and odour of eternity, a rosy-blessed, brown, 
gold-wine-odour of old happiness. 

Of drunken midnight-death happiness, which singeth: 
the world is deep, and deeper than the day could read! 



Leave me alone! Leave me alone! I am too pure for thee. 
Touch me not! Hath not my world just now become perfect? 

My skin is too pure for thy hands. Leave me alone, thou dull, 
doltish, stupid day! Is not the midnight brighter? 

The purest are to be masters of the world, the least known, 
the strongest, the midnight-souls, who are brighter and deeper 
than any day. 

O day, thou gropest for me? Thou feelest for my happiness? 
For thee am I rich, lonesome, a treasure-pit, a gold chamber? 

O world, thou wantest me? Am I worldly for thee? Am 1 
spiritual for thee? Am I divine for thee? But day and world, 
ye are too coarse, 

Have cleverer hands, grasp after deeper happiness, after 
deeper unhappiness, grasp after some God; grasp not after me: 
Mine unhappiness, my happiness is deep, thou strange 
day, but yet am I no God, no God s-hell: deep is its woe.

God s woe is deeper, thou strange world! Grasp at God s 
woe, not at me! What am I! A drunken sweet lyre, 

A midnight-lyre, a bell-frog, which no one understand- 
eth, but which must speak before deaf ones, ye higher men! 
For ye do not understand me! 

Gone! Gone! O youth! O noontide! O afternoon! Now have 
come evening and night and midnight, the dog howleth, the 
wind: 

Is the wind not a dog? It whineth, it barketh, it howleth. 
Ah! Ah! how she sigheth! how she laugheth, how she wheezetb 
and panteth, the midnight! 

How she just now speaketh soberly, this drunken poetess! 
hath she perhaps overdrunk her drunkenness? hath she be 
come overawake? doth she ruminate? 

Her woe doth she ruminate over, in a dream, the old, deep 
midnight and still more her joy. For joy, although woe b&lt;" 
deep, joy is deeper still than grief can be.

Thou grape-vine! Why dost thou praise me? Have I not cut 
thee! I am cruel, thou bleedest : what meaneth thy praise of 
my drunken cruelty? 

"Whatever hath become perfect, everything mature 
wanteth to die!" so sayest thou. Blessed, blessed be the vint- 
iier s knife! But everything immature wanteth to live: alas! 

Woe saith: "Hence! Go! Away, thou woe!" But everything 
that suffereth wanteth to live, that it may become mature an^ 
lively and longing.

Longing for the further, the higher, the brighter. "I want 
heirs," so saith everything that suffereth, "I want children, I do 
not want myself," 

Joy, however, doth not want heirs, it doth not want children, 
j -jy wanteth itself, it wanteth eternity, it wanteth recurrence, 
it wanteth everything eternally-like-itself . 

Woe saith: "Break, bleed, thou heart! Wander, thou leg! 
Thou wing, fly! Onward! upward! thou pain!" Well! Cheer up! 
O mine old heart: Woe saith: "Hence! Go!"

Ye higher men, what think ye? Am I a soothsayer? Or a 
dreamer? Or a drunkard? Or a dream-reader? Or a midnight- 
bell? 

Or a drop of dew? Or a fume and fragrance of eternity? 
Hear ye it not? Smell ye it not? Just now hath my world become 
perfect, midnight is also mid-day, 

Pain is also a joy, curse is also a blessing, night is also a 
sun, go away! or ye will learn that a sage is also a fool. 

Said ye ever Yea to one joy? O my friends, then said ye Yea 
also unto all woe. All things are enlinked, enlaced and enam

Wanted ye ever once to come twice; said ye ever: "Thou 
pleasest me, happiness! Instant! Moment!" then wanted ye all 
^o come back again! 

All anew, all eternal, all enlinked, enlaced and enam

Ye eternal ones, ye love it eternally and for all time: and

What doth not joy want! it is thirstier, heartier, hungrier,

80. The Sign 



IN THE morning, however, after this night, Zarathustra 
jumped up from his couch, and, having girded his loins, he 
came out of his cave glowing and strong, like a morning sun 
coming out of gloomy mountains. 

"Thou great star," spake he, as he had spoken once before, 
"thou deep eye of happiness, what would be all thy happiness 
if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest! 

And if they remained in their chambers whilst thou art 
already awake, and comest and bestowest and distributest, how 
would thy proud modesty upbraid for it! 

Well! they still sleep, these higher men, whilst/ am awake: 
they are not my proper companions! Not for them do I wait 
here in my mountains. 

my work I want to be, at my day: but they understand 



360 THUS SPAKE ZAE.ATHUSTRA 

not what are the signs of my morning, my step is not fo&gt; 
them the awakening-call. 

They still sleep in my cave; their dream still drinketh at my 
drunken songs. The audient ear for me the obedient ear, is 
yet lacking in their limbs." 

This had Zarathustra spoken to his heart when the sun 
arose: then looked he inquiringly aloft, for he heard above 
him the sharp call of his eagle. "Well!" called he upwards, 
"thus is it pleasing and proper to me. Mine animals are awake, 
for 1 am awake. 

Mine eagle is awake, and like me honoureth the sun. With 
eagle-talons doth it grasp at the new light. Ye are my proper 
animals; I love you. 

But still do I lack my proper men!"- 

Thus spake Zarathustra; then, however, it happened that all 
on a sudden he became aware that he was flocked around and 
fluttered around, as if by innumerable birds, the whizzing of 
so many wings, however, and the crowding around his head 
was so great that he shut his eyes. And verily, there came down 
upon him as it were a cloud, like a cloud of arrows which 
poureth upon a new enemy. But behold, here it was a cloud of 
love, and showered upon a new friend. 

"What happeneth unto me?" thought Zarathustra in his 
Astonished heart, and slowly seated himself on the big stone 
which lay close to the exit from his cave. But while he grasped 
about with his hands, around him, above him and below him, 
and repelled the tender birds, behold, there then happened to 
him something still stranger: for he grasped thereby unawares 
into a mass of thick, warm, shaggy hair; at the same time, how 
ever, there sounded before him a roar, a long, soft lion-roar. 

"The sign cometh" said Zarathustra, and a change came 



THE SIGN 367 

over nis heart. And in truth, when it turned clear before him, 
there lay a yellow, powerful animal at his feet, resting its head 
on his knee, unwilling to leave him out of love, and doing 
like a dog which again findeth its old master. The doves, how 
ever, were no less eager with their love than the lion; and 
whenever a dove whisked over its nose, the lion shook its head 
and wondered and laughed. 

When all this went on Zarathustra spake only a word: ff Aly 
children are nigh, my children" , then he became quite mute 
His heart, however, was loosed, and from his eyes there 
dropped down tears and fell upon his hands. And he took no 
further notice of anything, but sat there motionless, without 
repelling the animals further. Then flew the doves to and fro, 
and perched on his shoulder, and caressed his white hair, and 
did not tire of their tenderness and joyousness. The strong lion, 
however, licked always the tears that fell on Zarathustra s 
hands, and roared and growled shyly. Thus did these animals 
do.- 

All this went on for a long time, or a short time : for properly 
speaking, there is no time on earth for such things . Mean 
while, however, the higher men had awakened in Zarathustra s 
cave, and marshalled themselves for a procession to go to meet 
Zarathustra, and give him their morning greeting: for they had 
found when they awakened that he no longer tarried with 
them. When, however, they reached the door of the cave and 
the noise of their steps had preceded them, the hon started 
violently; it turned away all at once from Zarathustra, and 
roaring wildly, sprang towards the cave. The higher men, 
however, when they heard the lion roaring, cried all aloud as 
with one voice, fled back and vanished in an instant. 

Zarathustra himself, however, stunned and strange, ros* 
from his seat, looked around him, stood there astonished, in 



368 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 

quired of his heart, bethought himself, and remained alone. 
"What did I hear?" said he at last, slowly, "what happened 
unto me just now?" 

But soon there came to him his recollection, and he took in 
at a glance all that had taken place between yesterday and to 
day. "Here is indeed the stone," said he, and stroked his beard, 
"on // sat I yester-morn; and here came the soothsayer unto me. 
and here heard I first the cry which I heard just now, the great 
cry of distress. 

O ye higher men, your distress was it that tne old soothsayer 
foretold to me yester-morn, 

Unto your distress did he want to seduce and tempt me: 
O Zarathustra, said he to me, I come to seduce thee to thy 
last sin/ 

To my last sin?" cried Zarathustra, and laughed angrily at 
his own words: "what hath been reserved for me as my last 
sin?" 

And once more Zarathustra became absorbed in himself, 
and sat down again on the big stone and meditated. Suddenly 
he sprang up, 

"Fellow-suffering! Fellow-suffering with the higher men!" 
he cried out, arid his countenance changed into brass. "Well. 1 
That hath had its time! 

My suffering and my fellow-suffering what matter about 
them! Do I then strive after happiness? I strive after my work! 

Well! The lion hath come, my children are nigh, Zarathustra 
hath grown ripe, mine hour hath come: 

This is my morning, my day beginneth: arise now, arise, 
thou great noontide!" 

Thus spake Zarathustra and left his cave, glowing and 
strong, like a morning sun coming out of gloomy mountains.
